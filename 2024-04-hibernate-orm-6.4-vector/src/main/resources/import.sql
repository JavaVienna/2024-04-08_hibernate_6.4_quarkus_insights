Composite SQL types For a long time, SQL was fully relational and every data model had to be modeled as table with columns and constraints. Then came the object relational hype and the SQL:1999 standard introduced support for structured types. With the XML hype coming next, the SQL:2003 standard added support for XML and in the SQL:2016 standard JSON support first appeared. Structured or unstructured, composite types have their use cases, so it was about time that Hibernate came up with an answer for these data types. Values of these composite types provide access to their sub-parts and do not have identity like a row of a table. In the realm of ORM, embeddable types have the same properties, so it is only natural to allow mapping to these SQL types. Struct mapping Mapping an embeddable to a named SQL object type, also known as structured type, is now possible by annotating either the embeddable type or the @Embedded field/property with @Struct(name = "…"). The hbm2ddl schema generation tool supports generating DDL to create and drop these structured types. Since the order of structured type attributes is important and has to match the expectations of Hibernate, users can compare the type definition until schema validation adds support for structured types as well. Considering this simple example mapping: @Embeddable @Struct(name = "my_point") public class Point { private int x; private int y; } will produce a schema similar to the following: create type my_point as ( x int not null, y int not null ) The name and the nullability of the struct column can be refined through applying a @Column on the persistent attribute. @Entity public class PointHolder { @Id private int id; @Column(name = "the_point", nullable = false) private Point p; } which will emit a schema similar to this: create table PointHolder as ( id int not null primary key, the_point my_point not null ) Since the order of structured type attributes is vital, it is important to understand how to control the expectations of Hibernate. There are essentially two possible ways to control the order: Specifying the attributes member on the @Struct annotation to define the order Using a Java record to implicitly specify the order through the canonical constructor The first option is pretty simple. If the desired order is (y,x), then the Point embeddable type needs to declare that by using @Struct(name = "my_point", attributes = {"y", "x"}). The second option is more interesting as it makes use of another new feature that was introduced in Hibernate 6.2, which is the support for Java records out of the box. @Embeddable @Struct(name = "my_point") public record Point(int y, int x) {} There is no need for the @EmbeddableInstantiator anymore for Java records, because Hibernate now configures an appropriate instantiator automatically based on the canonical constructor. The order of the record components in that canonical constructor then also represents the order in which Hibernate expects the structured types attributes to be defined in. At the time of writing, structured type support is only implemented for Oracle, PostgreSQL and DB2. XML and JSON mapping Since XML and JSON are predefined unstructured types, there is no type name or attribute order that has to be defined. Mapping an embeddable as XML or JSON can be done by annotating the @Embedded field/property with @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.SQLXML) or @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON) respectively. At the time of writing, there is no database dialect for which XML support has been implemented, so the following will focus on the JSON parts only, but apply the same way to XML support in the future. @Entity public class JsonHolder { @Id private int id; @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON) @Column(name = "my_json", nullable = false) private Point point; } An entity with a mapping like this will roughly produce a schema like the following: create table JsonHolder as ( id int not null primary key, my_json json not null, check (json_value(my_json, ''$.x'') is not null and json_value(my_json, ''$.y'') is not null) ) As you can see, the table definition contains a check constraint that enforces the constraints of the embeddable type within the JSON value by accessing the fields through the json_value function. HQL queries that make use of embeddable attributes select j.point.x, j.point.y from JsonHolder j will resolve to the respective json_value expression: select json_value(j.point, ''$.x''), json_value(j.point, ''$.y'') from JsonHolder j Similarly, assignment expressions will update the relevant part of the json document. At the time of writing, JSON support is only implemented for Oracle and PostgreSQL. Outlook In upcoming releases we plan to add support for struct types on SQL Server, as well as support for other databases for the XML and JSON mappings. We will also try to lift restrictions on composite type mappings and enable the use of association mappings as well as array mappings. I hope you like the new features and can provide us feedback about this in the forum or on our chat platform!', 'Hibernate ORM 6.2 - Composite aggregate mappings', 'https://in.relation.to/2023/02/13/hibernate-orm-62-composite-aggregates/', null);
-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marko Bekhta', 'We just published Hibernate Search 7.1.0.Alpha2, a second alpha release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search. This version brings more vector search capabilities and improvements as well as integrates Elasticsearch’s/OpenSearch’s vector search capabilities. What’s new Hibernate Search 7.1 is still in its early stages of development: some features are still incomplete or may change in a backward-incompatible way. Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-5060) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4.2.Final. Which brings among other things a couple of fixes to address possible issues with mass indexing when an ORM discriminator multi tenancy is in use. Lucene (HSEARCH-5043) The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.9.1. Which beyond other improvements brings better performance for vector search. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-5032) The Elasticsearch backend now is also compatible with Elasticsearch 8.12 as well as with other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-5032: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.12.0 HSEARCH-5057: Upgrade to AWS SDK 2.23.3 HSEARCH-5047: Upgrade to JBeret 2.2.0.Final Vector search for Lucene and Elasticsearch Backends This version of Hibernate Search builds on top of the previous alpha and integrates Elasticsearch/OpenSearch vector search capabilities. To recap: vector search provides the tools to search over binary (images, audio or video) or text data: external tools convert that data to vectors (arrays of bytes or floats, also called "embeddings"), which are then used for indexing and queries in Hibernate Search. Hibernate Search introduces a new field type — @VectorField and a new predicate knn, so that the vectors can be indexed and then searched upon. Vector fields can work with vector data represented as byte or float arrays in the documents. Out of the box byte[] and float[] property types will work with the new field type. For any other entity property types, a custom value bridge or value binder should be implemented. Keep in mind that indexed vectors must be of the same length and that this length should be specified upfront for the schema to be created: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @VectorField(dimension = 512) private float[] coverImageEmbeddings; // Other properties ... } Searching for vector similarities is performed via a knn predicate: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // provide the number of similar documents to look for: f.knn( 5 ) // the name of the vector field: .field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ) // matched documents will be the ones whose indexed vector // is "most similar" to this vector .matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) // additionally an optional filter can be supplied // to provide a regular fulltext search predicate .filter( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ).matching( "arthur" ) ) ).fetchHits( 20 ); By its nature a knn predicate will always try to find nearest vectors, even if the found vectors are quite far away from each other, i.e. are not that similar. This may lead to getting irrelevant results returned by the query. To address this, a knn predicate allows configuring the minimum required similarity: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // Create a knn predicate as usual: f.knn( 5 ).field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ).matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) // Specify the required minimum similarity value, to filter out irrelevant results: .requiredMinimumSimilarity( 5 ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Note that each backend may have its own specifics and limitations with regard to the vector search. For more details look at the related documentation. See this section of the reference documentation on vector fields and the one on a knn predicate for more information. This version of Hibernate Search brings some renaming related to the vector search. In particular: @VectorField#beamWidth becomes @VectorField#efConstruction as well as all related API/SPI methods (see HSEARCH-5056). @VectorField#maxConnections becomes @VectorField#m as well as all related API/SPI methods (see HSEARCH-5056). VectorSimilarity#INNER_PRODUCT becomes VectorSimilarity#DOT_PRODUCT and VectorSimilarity#MAX_INNER_PRODUCT is introduced to better align naming of vector similarity functions between backends (see HSEARCH-5038). Looking up the capabilities of each field in the metamodel It is now possible to see which capabilities (predicates/sorts/projections/etc.) are available for a field when inspecting the metamodel: SearchMapping mapping = /*...*/ ; // Retrieve a SearchIndexedEntity: SearchIndexedEntity<Book> bookEntity = mapping.indexedEntity( Book.class ); // Get the descriptor for that index. // The descriptor exposes the index metamodel: IndexDescriptor indexDescriptor = bookEntity.indexManager().descriptor(); // Retrieve a field by name // and inspect its capabilities if such field is present: indexDescriptor.field( "releaseDate" ).ifPresent( field -> { if ( field.isValueField() ) { // Get the descriptor for the field type: IndexValueFieldTypeDescriptor type = field.toValueField().type(); // Inspect the "traits" of a field type: // each trait represents a predicate/sort/projection/aggregation // that can be used on fields of that type. Set<String> traits = type.traits(); if ( traits.contains( IndexFieldTraits.Aggregations.RANGE ) ) { // ... } if ( traits.contains( IndexFieldTraits.Predicates.EXISTS ) ) { // ... } // ... } } ); Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-5034: Hibernate Search will allow passing BeanReference<? extends T> when registering beans to BeanConfigurationContext. HSEARCH-5004: Hibernate Search will default to Hibernate ORM’s defaults instead of forcing SqlTypes.CHAR for the OutboxEvent/Agent ID. And more.

Type pollution improvements We keep gradually improving Hibernate’s performance, with special regard to the type pollution issue currently affecting the JDK (see HHH-16629). Hibernate Gradle plugin Dropped support for JPA static metamodel generation Support for JPA static metamodel generation in the Hibernate Gradle plugin was dropped. You can find more details here. Bugfixes Entity associations and joins We have fixed some issues related to the handling of entity associations and joins: We now avoid joining tables in more scenarios and should only introduce joins when really needed (see HHH-16691). An error was causing a result multiplication when both FetchMode.JOIN and batching were used for retrieving @OneToMany associated items (see HHH-16570). We now throw an appropriate error when an entity join that is not a cross join doesn’t define an on clause (see HHH-16495). A lazy association in a @Cacheable entity was already retrieved as initialized (see HHH-16613). Query caching We have fixed several bugs related to query caches, specifically regarding the key used for the cache: The query cache key was not correctly serializable when working with an enabled @Filter or @TenantId (see HHH-16385). @Filter parameters were not included in the query cache key causing some inconsistent results when using different values (see HHH-16617). Query parameters were not always processed in the same order when generating the query cache key, causing sporadic cache misses expecially with a high number of parameters and criteria queries (see HHH-16594). Map type associations We have a couple bugs related to Map type associations: Using the @MapKey annotation led to wrongly generated SQL for inserts in some cases (see HHH-16370). An error was encountered when using an Embeddable typed element collection in a map association (see HHH-16540). Null Pointer Exceptions The latest Hibernate updates introduced a couple cases triggering a NullPointerException that were fixed: An NPE was encountered when generating the mapping metamodel if inheritance was used for an @IdClass (see HHH-16664). An entity with an @Any annotated attribute caused a null pointer when merging (see HHH-16532). There are many more improvements and bugfixes included in this version.

Hibernate failed to access a lazy fetched @ManyToOne association which was part of a composite @IdClass identifier when stored in L2 cache (see HHH-16673). A TransientObjectException was encountered when loading a versioned entity from the second level cache with a @OneToOne lazy mapping (see HHH-16745). Treated and generic association joins We addressed a couple issues that occurred when joining on generic or treated association paths: When joining on a treated association we failed to retrieve the attribute from the correct treat target type (see HHH-16574). When joining on a MappedSuperclass generic association there was a problem recognizing the association attribute from the concrete (see HHH-16693). Mapping the same column to different properties We have fixed several issues that were reported for different use cases which had problems when mapping the same underlying database column to different model properties (see HHH-15929). Batching and composite identifiers We have fixed a couple bugs related to composite identifiers when batching was enabled: Fetching an element collection on an entity with a composite @EmbeddedId identifier failed with batch enabled (see HHH-16740).

NOTE With the release of 6.3.0, 6.2 now moves into limited maintenance. Jakarta Persistence 3.2 Jakarta Persistence 3.2 is still under development, but we’ve already begun incorporating some of the changes into Hibernate. One specific change to be aware of in 6.3 is the clarification with regard to types of numeric literals in HQL/JPQL queries. You can check out the details, but the gist is - Integer - 123 Long - 123l, 123L BigInteger - 123bi, 123BI Double - 123.4 Float literal - 123.4f, 123.4F BigDecimal literal - 123.4bd, 123.4BD Notice that Hibernate’s BigInteger and BigDecimal suffix synatx has been standardized also. New documentation artifacts 2 new documentation guides have been added - An introductory Hibernate 6 Guide The Hibernate Query Language synatx and feature guide Query methods Hibernate can now generate DAO-style methods for named queries as part of its JPA static metamodel generator. Take the following entity as an example: @NamedQuery(name = "#findByTitleAndType", query = "select book from Book book where book.title like :titlePattern and book.type = :type") @Entity public class Book { ... } When processed by the metamodel generator, Hibernate adds the following into the static metamodel: class Book_ { // as normal ... public static final String QUERY_FIND_BY_TITLE_AND_TYPE = "#findByTitleAndType"; public static List<Book> findByTitleAndType(@Nonnull EntityManager entityManager, String titlePattern, Type type) { return entityManager.createNamedQuery(QUERY_FIND_BY_TITLE_AND_TYPE) .setParameter("titlePattern", titlePattern) .setParameter("type", type) .getResultList(); } } And the application can then use: List<Book> books = Book_.findByTitleAndType(entityManager, titlePattern, Type.BOOK); There are a lot of capabilities to these query methods; see the Hibernate 6 Guide for a full discussion. Finder methods Using the new @Find annotation, arbitrary methods can now be processed by the generator to create finder methods similar to query methods. interface Dao { @Find Book findBookByIsbn(String isbn); } The generator will generate: class Dao_ { public static Book findBookByIsbn(@Nonnull EntityManager entityManager, String isbn) { return entityManager.unwrap(Session.class) .byNaturalId(Book.class) .using(Book_.isbn, isbn) .load(); } } Again, there are a lot of capabilities to these finder methods; see the Hibernate 6 Guide for a full discussion. Dynamic SUBSELECT fetch support Hibernate’s SUBSELECT fetching style can now be applied dynamically using fetch profiles. E.g. @FetchProfile(name = "EagerBook") @FetchProfile(name = "EagerBookWithSubselect") @Entity class Book { ... @ManyToMany @FetchProfileOverride(profile = Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK, mode = JOIN) @FetchProfileOverride(profile = Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK_WITH_SUBSELECT, mode = SUBSELECT) Set<Author> authors; } Then, at runtime we can pick between these profiles to control how the associations are loaded - Session session = ...; session.enableFetchProfile( Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK ); // or session.enableFetchProfile( Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK_WITH_SUBSELECT ); NOTE What’s up with those Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK references? See the Hibernate 6 Guide Create Criteria from HQL 6.3 adds the abillity to create a Criteria reference from HQL - var builder = session.getFactory().getCriteriaBuilder(); var hqlCriteria = session.getFactory() .getCriteriaBuilder() .createQuery( "select id, text from Message order by received", Object[].class ); which can be mutated just like any Criteria… var root = hqlCriteria.getRootList().get(0) root.where( builder.equal( root.get(Message_.deleted), ''Y'' ) ); CriteriaDefinition utility The new CriteriaDefinition class is a utility for making it easier to work with Jakarta Persistence Criterias in many case. E.g. var query = new CriteriaDefinition<>(factory, Message.class) {{ var message = from(Message.class); where(like(message.get("text"), "hell%"), message.get("id").equalTo(1)); orderBy(asc(message.get("id"))); }}; Session session = ...; var message = session.createSelectionQuery(query).getSingleResult(); We can even use this to clean up the example from Create Criteria from HQL - var query = new CriteriaDefinition<>(factory, Object[].class, "select id, text from Message order by received") {{ var root = getRootList().get(0); where( equal( root.get(Message_.deleted), ''Y'' ); }}; StatelessSession.upsert() The new StatelessSession.upsert() method allows performing SQL-style UPSERT/MERGE operations from the Hibernate StatelessSession. // insert it ss.upsert(new Widget(1, "the nema")); // update it ss.upsert(new Widget(1, "the name")); Community For additional details, see: the Migration Guide the User Guide the Introduction Guide the release page the incubating report the deprecation report the internals report the compatibility policy See the website for getting in touch with us.', 'Hibernate 6.3.0 (and 6.2.8)', 'https://in.relation.to/2023/08/31/orm-630/', null);

See this section of the reference documentation for more information, or this getting started guide. In this release, there were several improvements to the configuration of the Standalone POJO mapper: HSEARCH-4615: More configuration is set simply through configuration properties. HSEARCH-4620: Indexing plan synchronization is now configured through strategies, just like with the ORM mapper. Mapping index content to custom types (projection constructors) In a previous release, Hibernate Search 6.2 introduced the ability to define projections through the mapping of custom types (typically records), by applying the @ProjectionConstructor annotation to those types or their constructor. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. In this release, there were several improvements to the projection constructors: HSEARCH-4579: With the Standalone POJO Mapper, when searching on an entity type with no loading configured, Hibernate Search will now attempt to use that entity type’s projection constructor if it exists. HSEARCH-4591: Object projections are now allowed on single-valued, flattened object fields with the Lucene backend. HSEARCH-4669: Hibernate Search will provide more information when a projection constructor cannot be applied to an index. HSEARCH-4673: The -parameters compiler flag is no longer necessary when using the default constructor of records as projection constructor. Mapping improvements HSEARCH-4714: Property names in the mapping, e.g. @IndexingDependency(derivedFrom = …), will now be checked early to provide a clear error message in case of incorrect syntax. HSEARCH-4782: Hibernate Search will now infer a default decimal scale automatically for identifiers of Hibernate ORM entities; previously it was only inferred for non-identifier properties. Search DSL improvements Simpler boolean operators with the and/or/not predicates (HSEARCH-4601/HSEARCH-4645) For simpler use cases, you can now avoid the rather complex bool predicate and use the new and/or/not predicates instead: List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.and( f.match().field( "title" ) .matching( "robot" ), f.match().field( "description" ) .matching( "crime" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.or( f.match().field( "title" ) .matching( "robot" ), f.match().field( "description" ) .matching( "investigation" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.not( f.match() .field( "genre" ) .matching( Genre.SCIENCE_FICTION ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Simpler and predicate for where( (f, b) → … ) (HSEARCH-4676) Instead of a bool predicate` as in 6.2.0.Alpha1, where( (f, b) → … ) now provides a simpler and predicate: MySearchParameters searchParameters = getSearchParameters(); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( (f, root) -> { root.add( f.matchAll() ); if ( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.match().field( "genre" ) .matching( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() ) ); } if ( searchParameters.getFullTextFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.match().fields( "title", "description" ) .matching( searchParameters.getFullTextFilter() ) ); } if ( searchParameters.getPageCountMaxFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.range().field( "pageCount" ) .atMost( searchParameters.getPageCountMaxFilter() ) ); } } ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Simpler and predicate for the nested predicate (HSEARCH-4676) Instead of a bool predicate` as in as in 6.2.0.Alpha1 6.2.0.Alpha1, f.nested( … ) now provides a simpler and predicate: List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.nested( "authors" ) .add( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ) .matching( "isaac" ) ) .add( f.match().field( "authors.lastName" ) .matching( "asimov" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Mass indexing improvements Mass indexing multiple tenants (HSEARCH-4321) In multi-tenant applications, mass indexing can now handle multiple tenants at once, provided you don’t pass any tenant identifier when creating the mass indexer, and you provided a list of tenants in the Hibernate Search configuration. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Setting up thread locals during mass indexing (HSEARCH-1809) The mass indexer now has a concept of "mass indexing environment", allowing for instance to set up custom thread locals in mass indexing threads. See the environment parameter in this section of the reference documentation for more information. Better exception handling (HSEARCH-4541) Exceptions thrown by Hibernate ORM during mass indexing are now passed to the failure handler as every other exception, instead of aborting the whole mass indexing. Smarter defaults for parameters (HSEARCH-4612) purgeAllOnStart is now disabled by default in the mass indexer when dropAndCreateSchemaOnStart is enabled. outbox-polling coordination improvements Outbox events and agents now use UUIDs for their identifiers (HSEARCH-4678/HSEARCH-4748) The primary key of the relevant tables are now using UUIDs instead of longs, to avoid reliance on sequences that were slowing down event processing on some databases. The migration guide includes migration scripts for the necessary database schema changes. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4618: BooleanPredicateOptionsCollector/SimpleBooleanPredicateClausesCollector now expose a hasClause() method. HSEARCH-4294: The Search DSL now allows targeting "implicit" Elasticsearch fields such as _index. HSEARCH-4644: Hibernate Search is now tested regularly against CockroachDB. HSEARCH-4679: Hibernate Search will now automatically simplify boolean predicates with a single clause. HSEARCH-4305, HSEARCH-4708: Automatic reindexing will no longer be skipped when changing a property annotated with @OneToOne(mappedBy = …) @IndexedEmbedded HSEARCH-4727: With outbox-polling coordination and when using DB2, OutboxEvent table used to be created with a payload column with the wrong type blob(255), making it almost unusable. It is no longer the case. HSEARCH-4634, HSEARCH-4647: outbox-polling coordination now works with CockroachDB. HSEARCH-4652: Schema validation with the Elasticsearch backend will no longer fail when setting searchAnalyzer to the same value as analyzer on a full-text field. HSEARCH-4654: Hibernate Search will no longer deadlock when experiencing a large number of concurrent failures during startup or schema validation. HSEARCH-4701: When running Hibernate Search as a Java module (in the modulepath), Elasticsearch schema management will no longer lead to exceptions caused by missing inter-module dependencies. HSEARCH-4703: Fixed missing entries in the Java module descriptor of hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling leading to errors when running Hibernate Search in the modulepath. HSEARCH-4724: Classpath scanning (for projection constructors in particular) no longer ignores classes within Spring Boot’s "repackaged" JARs. And more.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marko Bekhta', 'We just published Hibernate Search 7.1.0.CR1, a first candidate release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search. This version brings a lot of updates and improvements for working with a Standalone POJO mapper, new query string predicate, and takes advantage of Elasticsearch 8.12 to remove some of the limitations on vector search capabilities. What’s new For a summary of all new features and improvements since 7.0, head to the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-5078) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4.4.Final. Lucene (HSEARCH-5069) The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.9.2, which brings some bug fixes related to vector search. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-5077) The Elasticsearch backend now is compatible with Elasticsearch latest 8.12.1 as well as with other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-5077: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.12.1 HSEARCH-5074: Upgrade to JBeret 2.2.1.Final knn predicate updates With the 8.12 release of Elasticsearch, a new knn query was introduced. This query is more aligned with the vector search capabilities provided by Hibernate Search, and integration with Elasticsearch was updated to use this new query. This means that previous limitations imposed on the vector search when using the Elastic distribution of the Elasticsearch backend are now removed. It also means that vector search on Elasticsearch is now only available with Elasticsearch 8.12 and later; Hibernate Search no longer supports vector search on Elasticsearch 8.11 and earlier. To remind how vector search works: for vector fields to be indexed, they should be annotated with a @VectorField annotation: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @VectorField(dimension = 512) private float[] coverImageEmbeddings; // Other properties ... } Then, searching for vector similarities is performed via a knn predicate: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // provide the number of similar documents to look for: f.knn( 5 ) // the name of the vector field: .field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ) // matched documents will be the ones whose indexed vector // is "most similar" to this vector .matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) ).fetchHits( 20 ); See this section of the reference documentation on vector fields and the one on a knn predicate for more information. Query string predicate The queryString predicate matches documents according to a structured query given as a string. It allows building more advanced query strings (using Lucene’s query language) and has more configuration options than a simpleQueryString predicate. List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.queryString().field( "description" ) .matching( "robots +(crime investigation disappearance)^10 +\"investigation help\"~2 -/(dis)?a[p]+ea?ance/" ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The query string, in this predicate, will result in a boolean query with 4 clauses: a should clause matching robots; two must clauses another boolean query constructed from (crime || investigation || disappearance) string with a boost of 10 a query matching the phrase investigation help with the phrase slop equals to 2 a must not clause matching a regular expression (dis)?a[p]+ea?ance Note that each of the mentioned clauses may itself end up being translated into other types of queries. See this section of the reference documentation on the queryString predicate for more information. Simpler entity registration in the Standalone POJO mapper Hibernate Search simplifies how entities can be defined. For standalone mapper now it is enough to annotate your entities with the @SearchEntity annotation. @SearchEntity (1) // ... Other annotations, e.g. @Indexed if this entity needs to be mapped to an index. public class Book { @Id private Integer id; // Other properties ... } 1 Annotate the type with @SearchEntity so it is treated as an entity. Another update related to this is a way the SearchMappingBuilder builder is created. Now it requires an annotated type source to be provided. CloseableSearchMapping searchMapping = SearchMapping.builder( AnnotatedTypeSource.fromClasses( (1) Book.class, Associate.class, Manager.class )) .property( "hibernate.search.backend.hosts", "elasticsearch.mycompany.com" ) (2) // ... .build(); (3) 1 Create a builder, passing an AnnotatedTypeSource to let Hibernate Search know where to look for annotations. Thanks to classpath scanning, your AnnotatedTypeSource only needs to include one class from each JAR containing annotated types. Other types should be automatically discovered. 2 Set additional configuration properties. 3 Build the SearchMapping. See this section of the reference documentation on the entity definition for more information. Targeting entities by name in the Standalone POJO Mapper The standalone POJO mapper adds a new way, previously available for Hibernate ORM integration only, for creating a search scope from type names. The type name for the standalone POJO mapper is the name used when registering an entity, be it via the @SearchEntity(name=…) annotation or through the programmatic definition using .searchEntity(). SearchMapping searchMapping = /* ... */ (1) SearchScope<Book> bookScope = searchMapping.scope( Book.class ); (2) SearchScope<Person> personSubTypesScope = searchMapping.scope( Person.class, List.of( "Manager", "Associate" ) ); (3) 1 Retrieve the SearchMapping. 2 Create a SearchScope targeting only the Book entity type using a class. 3 Create a SearchScope targeting only the Manager and Associate subtypes using their entity names. See this section of the reference documentation on the ways to create search scope for more information. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-5020: Hibernate Search increases the maximum allowed vector dimension for a Lucene backend to 4096 to allow indexing longer vectors produced by some models. HSEARCH-5073: Hibernate Search now allows specifying a minimum-should-match parameter on a simple query predicate. And more.

New documentation 6.3 provides 2 new documentation guides: An introductory Hibernate 6 Guide The Hibernate Query Language synatx and feature guide Query methods Hibernate can now generate DAO-style methods for named queries as part of its JPA static metamodel generator. Take the following entity as an example: @NamedQuery(name = "#findByTitleAndType", query = "select book from Book book where book.title like :titlen and book.type = :type") @Entity public class Book { ... } When processed by the metamodel generator, we will now have the following generated into the static metamodel: class Book_ { // as normal ... public static final String QUERY_FIND_BY_TITLE_AND_TYPE = "#findByTitleAndType"; public static List<Book> findByTitleAndType(@Nonnull EntityManager entityManager, String title, Type type) { return entityManager.createNamedQuery(QUERY_FIND_BY_TITLE_AND_TYPE) .setParameter("titlePattern", title) .setParameter("type", type) .getResultList(); } } And the application can then use: List<Book> books = Book_.findByTitleAndType(entityManager, titlePattern, Type.BOOK); There are a lot of capabilities to these query methods; see the Hibernate 6 Guide for a full discussion. Finder methods Using the new @Find annotation, arbitrary methods can now be processed by the generator to create finder methods similar to query methods. interface Dao { @Find Book findBookByIsbn(String isbn); } The generator will generate: class Dao_ { public static Book findBookByIsbn(@Nonnull EntityManager entityManager, String isbn) { return entityManager.unwrap(Session.class) .byNaturalId(Book.class) .using(Book_.isbn, isbn) .load(); } } Again, there are a lot of capabilities to these finder methods; see the Hibernate 6 Guide for a full discussion.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Andrea Boriero', 'Hibernate ORM 6.4.0 has just been released. Simultaneously, 6.3.2 has also been released. 6.4 adds some cool new features, in addition to many improvements and fixes. Soft Delete 6.4 adds support for soft deletes using the new @SoftDelete annotation. @Entity @SoftDelete class Account { ... } Dealing with values as deleted/non-deleted versus active/inactive (reversed) is simple using an annotation attribute: @Entity @SoftDelete(strategy=ACTIVE) class Account { ... } It even supports pluggable converters for dealing with what gets stored in the database. See the User Guide for details. HQL Vector Support 6.4 introduces a new module hibernate-vector that offers support for mathematical vector types and functions that are useful for the AI/ML space to do vector similarity search. The current implementation only supports running with PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension enabled and maps various functions to the underlying pgvector operators that enable efficient index access. See the Query Guide for details. HQL/Criteria Array Functions Following up on earlier work, 6.4 adds the remaining functions for handling arrays in HQL and Criteria queries. See the Query Guide for excellent coverage of these functions. These functions are still incubating and some things (names, etc.) may change before Final. Java Flight Recorder Events 6.4 adds support for producing Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events. This works natively on many JDKs, but we recently discovered that not all of them implement the JFR spec, despite it being part of Open JDK. For this reason we have created a separate module that will ensure compatibility, and applications will need to include the new hibernate-jfr artifact on the classpath in order to use Java Flight Recorder events integration.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marco Belladelli', 'Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: 6.2.2.Final. What’s new This release includes several bug fixes and small performance improvements. Batch fetch performance The performance of batch fetch loading (@BatchSize) has been improved by better caching of SQL AST and other references where possible. See HHH-16441 for details. SQL ARRAY for multi-key loads When loading entities or collections by multiple keys, Hibernate can now utilize a SQL ARRAY valued parameter to pass all ids at once. This is implemented for all multi-key loads: Batch fecthing Session#byMultipleIds Session#byMultipleNaturalId This is limited to single-column keys and databases which support ARRAY types. In cases where an ARRAY parameter cannot be used, Hibernate falls back to its padded strategy which uses a pre-built SQL AST with a fix-sized IN parameter list. See HHH-16466 for details. Bugfixes Table resolution and self referencing associations We have fixed how Hibernate internally resolves the table references to use in a query, with special care put towards self referencing associations and possible optimizations using foreign key columns (see HHH-16382 and related issues). Bytecode Enhancement We have fixed a couple issues related to bytecode enhancement: Faulty code was generated when bidirectional association management was enabled, preventing Hibernate from correctly handling both sides of the association (see HHH-15602). When both a lazy @ManyToOne association and an eager one were used on the same entity, in some cases Hibernate would not eagerly initialize the latter (see HHH-16477). GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses We have fixed several bugs related to GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses: When grouping by an entity valued property (like a to-one association), we now always expand the rendered GROUP BY clause to use all columns of the entity type to guarantee that the underlying DBMS can correctly group the selections (see HHH-16409). When using window or ordered-set aggregate functions, we now explicitly disallow using aliased or positional expressions in the ORDER BY clause to prevent problematic query interpretation. We also fixed a bug that was preventing users from ordering by multiple column expression in OVER and WITHIN GROUP clauses (see HHH-16347). @Where clause We fixed a bug causing the @Where clause to be mis-rendered when used in a delete mutation query, specifically for the subquery to clean up association tables (see HHH-16392). Sybase and jConnect JDBC driver We have fixed several issues encountered when using Sybase with the jConnect JDBC driver, for a detailed view of the fixes please see the full list of changes link at the bottom of the page. Java Records Support for Java Records annotated with @Embeddable was introduced with Hibernate 6.2, but there were still a couple issues: Java Record embeddables were not included in the JPA metamodel generation (see HHH-16261). Java Record embeddables properties were not correctly ordered in ValueAccess#getValues() (see HHH-16457). Generics We continue to improve support for using Java Generics in entity classes, this time we solved an issue regarding a generic enum property annotated with @Enumerated (see HHH-16479).

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We just published Hibernate Search 6.2.0.Beta1, a beta release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search. This version brings highlighting in the Search DSL, indexing plan filters to suspend automatic indexing, an Elasticsearch schema export tool, mapping annotations for constructor parameters when using @ProjectionConstructor, and .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() options in sorts. 6.2.0.Beta1 also includes many bugfixes and improvements, compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.8 and OpenSearch 2.7, an upgrade of -orm6 artifacts to Hibernate ORM 6.2.4.Final, and more. What’s new Hibernate Search 6.2 is still in development: some features are still incomplete or may change in a backward-incompatible way. Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-4860) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.2.4.Final for -orm6 artifacts. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-4857) The Elasticsearch backend now works with Elasticsearch 8.8 as well as other versions that were already compatible. OpenSearch (HSEARCH-4850) The Elasticsearch backend now works with OpenSearch 2.7 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-4857: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.8.0 Highlighting With HSEARCH-2192, Hibernate Search now offers a new feature in the Search DSL: highlighting. Highlighting is a projection that returns fragments from full-text fields of matched documents that caused a query match. Specific terms that caused the match are "highlighted" with a pair of opening and closing tags. It can help a user to quickly identify the information they were searching for on a results page. For example, one can enable highlighting on a full-text field like this: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @FullTextField(analyzer = "english") private String title; @FullTextField(analyzer = "english", highlightable = Highlightable.ANY) private String description; } And then retrieve highlights like this: SearchSession searchSession = /* ... */ List<List<String>> result = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.highlight( "description" ) ) .where( f -> f.match().field( "description" ).matching( "robot" ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Which can for example return the following highlights: # Hit #0 ["A <em>robot</em> becomes self-aware."] # Hit #1 ["A <em>robot</em> helps investigate a murder on an extrasolar colony.", "On this planet, <em>robots</em> are used extensively."] # etc. This is a simple example, but highligting can be configured extensively. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Indexing plan filters With HSEARCH-168/HSEARCH-1383, Hibernate Search now allow enabling/disabling indexing in indexing plans (which include in particular automatic indexing), both fully (for all types) or on a per-type basis. For example, the following will disable automatic indexing for future changes on all instances of the class Company, except for instances of its subclass Customer: SearchMapping searchMapping = /* ... */ searchMapping.indexingPlanFilter( ctx -> ctx.exclude( Company.class ) .include( Customer.class ) ); Indexing plan filters can also be configured per-session (though limitations apply when using the outbox-polling coordination strategy): SearchSession searchSession = /* ... */ searchSession.indexingPlanFilter( ctx -> ctx.exclude( Company.class ) .include( Customer.class ) ); See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Mapping annotations for constructor parameters when using @ProjectionConstructor HSEARCH-4574 adds mapping annotations for constructor parameters when using @ProjectionConstructor. This means in particular you can now project to other things than just fields when using @ProjectionConstructor, for example the entity identifier: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookIdAndTitleProjection( @IdProjection (1) Integer id, String title (2) ) { } 1 Projects to the entity identifier (explicit projection through an explicit annotation) 2 Projects to field title (implicit projection) But this also allows configuring field projections more precisely, for example setting the path of a field projection to something else than just the name of the constructor parameter: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookTitleAndAuthorNamesProjection( @FieldProjection (1) String title, @FieldProjection(path = "authors.lastName") (2) List<String> authorLastNames ) { } 1 Projects to field title (path derived from the name of the constructor parameter) 2 Projects to field authors.lastName (explicit path) See this section of the reference documentation for more information about this feature in general, and the documentation of each projection for more information about each available annotation. Search DSL improvements .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() options in sorts (HSEARCH-4149) When sorting on a field that may not have a value for some documents, it was already possible to use .missing().first()/.missing().last() to tell Hibernate Search to put such documents in first/last position (respectively), regardless of sorting order (ascending/descending). It is now possible, as an alternative, to use .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() to tell Hibernate Search to consider such documents as having the lowest/highest value (respectively), taking into account sorting order (ascending/descending): .missing().lowest() puts documents with no value in the first position when using ascending order or in the last position when using descending order. .missing().highest() puts documents with no value in the last position when using ascending order or in the first position when using descending order. This is mostly useful when the position of missing values is hardcoded, but the sort order is given by the user: SortOrder orderFromUser = /* ... */; List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .sort( f -> f.field( "pageCount" ).missing().lowest().order( orderFromuser ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Elasticsearch schema export It is now possible to export the Elasticsearch schema that Hibernate Search expects to JSON files on the filesystem: SearchSchemaManager schemaManager = searchSession.schemaManager(); schemaManager.exportExpectedSchema( Path.of( "mydirectory" ) ); The code above will result in a directory tree similar to this: # For the default backend: backend/indexes/<index-name>/<file> mydirectory/backend/indexes/customer/create-index.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/customer/create-index-query-params.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/order/create-index.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/order/create-index-query-params.json # For additional named backends: backend/<backend-name>/indexes/<index-name>/<file> mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/user/create-index.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/user/create-index-query-params.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/usergroup/create-index.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/usergroup/create-index-query-params.json See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4808: Added a new configuration option for the Elasticsearch client’s connection keep-alive: hibernate.search.backend.max_keep_alive. HSEARCH-4772: Reporting of non-fatal failures during mass indexing is now limited to a certain number of failures, which will prevent those failures from flooding the logs. The limit can be customized with MassIndexer#failureFloodingThreshold(long). HSEARCH-4843: The various module-specific EntityReference interfaces are now deprecated; use the common org.hibernate.search.engine.common.EntityReference instead. HSEARCH-4827: The object projection will no longer allow inner projections that are not affected by nesting (e.g. id, score, …). HSEARCH-4803: Hibernate Search will now properly ignore internal ServiceConfigurationErrors when appropriate. HSEARCH-4825: Hibernate Search-generated Elasticsearch dynamic templates will now be merged with those defined by custom mappings, instead of being erased as soon as a custom mapping are defined (even if those didn’t mention any dynamic templates). HSEARCH-4853: Hibernate Search will now properly handle canonical record constructors used as projection constructors on JDK 21-ea+21 and above. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, Hibernate Search 6.2 is a drop-in replacement for 6.1, assuming you also upgrade the dependencies. Information about deprecated configuration and API is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas? To get in touch, use the following channels: hibernate-search tag on Stackoverflow (usage questions) User forum (usage questions, general feedback) Issue tracker (bug reports, feature requests) Mailing list (development-related discussions)', 'Hibernate Search 6.2.0.Beta1 is out', 'https://in.relation.to/2023/06/02/hibernate-search-6-2-0-Beta1/', null);
-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We are pleased to announce the release of Hibernate Search 6.2.0.Final. This release brings in particular a new standalone POJO Mapper, mapping of classes/records to projections using @ProjectionConstructor, highlighting, Elasticsearch schema export, and more bugfixes and improvements. 6.2.0.Final also includes compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.8 and OpenSearch 2.8, as well as an upgrade of -orm6 artifacts to Hibernate ORM 6.2. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 6.1 Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM Hibernate Search still depends on Hibernate ORM 5.6 by default. -orm6 artifacts depend on Hibernate ORM 6.2. Lucene The Lucene backend still uses Lucene 8.11. Elasticsearch The Elasticsearch backend now works with Elasticsearch 8.8 and 7.17 as well as other versions that were already compatible. OpenSearch The Elasticsearch backend now works with OpenSearch 1.3 and 2.8 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Standalone POJO Mapper The Standalone POJO Mapper enables mapping arbitrary POJOs to indexes. Its key feature compared to the Hibernate ORM integration is its ability to run without Hibernate ORM or a relational database. It can be used to index entities coming from an arbitrary datastore or even (though that’s not recommended in general) to use Lucene or Elasticsearch as a primary datastore. For more information about the Standalone POJO Mapper, see this section of the reference documentation. To get started with the Standalone POJO Mapper, see this getting started guide. Mapping index content to custom types (projection constructors) Hibernate Search now offers the ability to define projections through the mapping of custom types (typically records), by applying the @ProjectionConstructor annotation to those types or their constructor: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookProjection(String title, List<Author> authors) { @ProjectionConstructor public record Author(String firstName, String lastName) { } } Executing such a projection then becomes as easy as referencing the custom type: List<MyBookProjection> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( MyBookProjection.class ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); More advanced projections can be configured through explicit annotations, for example a projection to the entity identifier: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookIdAndTitleProjection( @IdProjection (1) Integer id, String title (2) ) { } 1 Projects to the entity identifier (explicit projection through an explicit annotation) 2 Projects to field title (implicit projection) Explicit annotations also allow configuring field projections more precisely, for example setting the path of a field projection to something else than just the name of the constructor parameter: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookTitleAndAuthorNamesProjection( @FieldProjection (1) String title, @FieldProjection(path = "authors.lastName") (2) List<String> authorLastNames ) { } 1 Projects to field title (path derived from the name of the constructor parameter) 2 Projects to field authors.lastName (explicit path) See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Highlighting Hibernate Search now offers a new feature in the Search DSL: highlighting. Highlighting is a projection that returns fragments from full-text fields of matched documents that caused a query match. Specific terms that caused the match are "highlighted" with a pair of opening and closing tags. It can help a user to quickly identify the information they were searching for on a results page. For example, one can enable highlighting on a full-text field like this: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @FullTextField(analyzer = "english") private String title; @FullTextField(analyzer = "english", projectable = Projectable.YES) private String description; } And then retrieve highlights like this: SearchSession searchSession = /* ... */ List<List<String>> result = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.highlight( "description" ) ) .where( f -> f.match().field( "description" ).matching( "robot" ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Which can for example return the following highlights: # Hit #0 ["A <em>robot</em> becomes self-aware."] # Hit #1 ["A <em>robot</em> helps investigate a murder on an extrasolar colony.", "On this planet, <em>robots</em> are used extensively."] # etc. This is a simple example, but highligting can be configured extensively. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Indexing plan filters Hibernate Search now allows enabling/disabling indexing in indexing plans (which includes in particular listener-triggered indexing), both fully (for all types) or on a per-type basis. For example, the following will disable automatic indexing for future changes on all instances of the class Company, except for instances of its subclass Customer: SearchMapping searchMapping = /* ... */ searchMapping.indexingPlanFilter( ctx -> ctx.exclude( Company.class ) .include( Customer.class ) ); Indexing plan filters can also be configured per-session (though limitations apply when using the outbox-polling coordination strategy): SearchSession searchSession = /* ... */ searchSession.indexingPlanFilter( ctx -> ctx.exclude( Company.class ) .include( Customer.class ) ); See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Mapping improvements @IndexedEmbedded(excludePaths = …) The @IndexedEmbedded annotation now exposes an excludePaths attribute, allowing the inclusion of all paths with only a few selectively excluded, as opposed to the pre-existing approach of selectively including paths with includePaths. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Projectable fields All fields are now projectable by default with the Elasticsearch backend. This change was made because making a field projectable doesn’t incur any performance penalty with the Elasticsearch backend. Since making a field projectable does have an impact on performance with the Lucene backend, the defaults with the Lucene backend didn’t change: Lucene fields still need to be made projectable explicitly. Search DSL improvements Simpler boolean operators with the and/or/not predicates For simpler use cases, you can now avoid the rather complex bool predicate and use the new and/or/not predicates instead: List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.and( f.match().field( "title" ) .matching( "robot" ), f.match().field( "description" ) .matching( "crime" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.or( f.match().field( "title" ) .matching( "robot" ), f.match().field( "description" ) .matching( "investigation" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.not( f.match() .field( "genre" ) .matching( Genre.SCIENCE_FICTION ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Shorter syntax for complex, root boolean predicates Instead of .where( f → f.bool( b → … ) ), you can now use .where( (f, b) → … ): MySearchParameters searchParameters = getSearchParameters(); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( (f, root) -> { root.add( f.matchAll() ); if ( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.match().field( "genre" ) .matching( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() ) ); } if ( searchParameters.getFullTextFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.match().fields( "title", "description" ) .matching( searchParameters.getFullTextFilter() ) ); } if ( searchParameters.getPageCountMaxFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.range().field( "pageCount" ) .atMost( searchParameters.getPageCountMaxFilter() ) ); } } ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The older syntax has been deprecated in favor of the new one. Clearer syntax for complex, non-root boolean predicates Instead of f.bool( b → … ), you can now use f.bool().with( b → … ): MySearchParameters searchParameters = getSearchParameters(); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( (f, b) -> { b.must( f.matchAll() ); if ( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() != null ) { b.must( f.match().field( "genre" ) .matching( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() ) ); } if ( !searchParameters.getAuthorFilters().isEmpty() ) { b.must( f.bool().with( b2 -> { for ( String authorFilter : searchParameters.getAuthorFilters() ) { b2.should( f.match().fields( "authors.firstName", "authors.lastName" ) .matching( authorFilter ) ); } } ) ); } } ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The older syntax has been deprecated in favor of the new one. Clearer syntax for the nested predicate Instead of f.nested().objectField( … ).nest( f.bool().must( … ) ), you can now use f.nested( … ).add( … ): List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.nested( "authors" ) .add( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ) .matching( "isaac" ) ) .add( f.match().field( "authors.lastName" ) .matching( "asimov" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The older syntax has been deprecated in favor of the new one. New matchNone predicate The matchNone predicate matches no documents. List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.matchNone() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); New syntax for composite projections The definition of composite projections is now possible with a fluent syntax: List<MyPair<String, Genre>> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.composite() .from( f.field( "title", String.class ), f.field( "genre", Genre.class ) ) .as( MyPair::new ) ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Most older syntaxes have been deprecated in favor of the new one. New object projection The object projection yields one projected value for each object in a given object field. List<List<MyAuthorName>> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.object( "authors" ) .from( f.field( "authors.firstName", String.class ), f.field( "authors.lastName", String.class ) ) .as( MyAuthorName::new ) .multi() ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); New constant projection The constant projection returns the same value for every single document, the value being provided when defining the projection. Instant searchRequestTimestamp = Instant.now(); List<MyPair<Integer, Instant>> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.composite() .from( f.id( Integer.class ), f.constant( searchRequestTimestamp ) ) .as( MyPair::new ) ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() options in sorts When sorting on a field that may not have a value for some documents, it was already possible to use .missing().first()/.missing().last() to tell Hibernate Search to put such documents in first/last position (respectively), regardless of sorting order (ascending/descending). It is now possible, as an alternative, to use .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() to tell Hibernate Search to consider such documents as having the lowest/highest value (respectively), taking into account sorting order (ascending/descending): .missing().lowest() puts documents with no value in the first position when using ascending order or in the last position when using descending order. .missing().highest() puts documents with no value in the last position when using ascending order or in the first position when using descending order. This is mostly useful when the position of missing values is hardcoded, but the sort order is given by the user: SortOrder orderFromUser = /* ... */; List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .sort( f -> f.field( "pageCount" ).missing().lowest().order( orderFromuser ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Mass indexing improvements Mass indexing multiple tenants In multi-tenant applications, mass indexing can now handle multiple tenants at once, provided you don’t pass any tenant identifier when creating the mass indexer, and you provided a list of tenants in the Hibernate Search configuration. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Setting up thread locals during mass indexing The mass indexer now has a concept of "mass indexing environment", allowing for instance to set up custom thread locals in mass indexing threads. See the environment parameter in this section of the reference documentation for more information. Better exception handling Exceptions thrown by Hibernate ORM during mass indexing are now passed to the failure handler as every other exception, instead of aborting the whole mass indexing. Smarter defaults for parameters purgeAllOnStart is now disabled by default in the mass indexer when dropAndCreateSchemaOnStart is enabled. outbox-polling coordination improvements Outbox events and agents now use UUIDs for their identifiers The primary key of the relevant tables are now using UUIDs instead of longs, to avoid reliance on sequences that were slowing down event processing on some databases. The migration guide includes migration scripts for the necessary database schema changes. Customizable database schema Simple, straightforward configuration properties now allow customizing the database schema involved in Hibernate Search’s outbox-polling coordination strategy: table names, schema and catalog, type of UUID columns as well as UUID generation strategy (random vs. time). See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Elasticsearch schema export It is now possible to export the Elasticsearch schema that Hibernate Search expects to JSON files on the filesystem: SearchSchemaManager schemaManager = searchSession.schemaManager(); schemaManager.exportExpectedSchema( Path.of( "mydirectory" ) ); The code above will result in a directory tree similar to this: # For the default backend: backend/indexes/<index-name>/<file> mydirectory/backend/indexes/customer/create-index.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/customer/create-index-query-params.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/order/create-index.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/order/create-index-query-params.json # For additional named backends: backend/<backend-name>/indexes/<index-name>/<file> mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/user/create-index.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/user/create-index-query-params.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/usergroup/create-index.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/usergroup/create-index-query-params.json See this section of the reference documentation for more information.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We just published a new candidate release for Hibernate Search: 7.0.0.CR1. This release brings in particular compatibility with Hibernate ORM’s discriminator-based multi-tenancy, compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.10 and OpenSearch 2.10/2.11, an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 6.3.1.Final, an upgrade to Lucene 9.8, some Maven artifact renamings, and other bugfixes and improvements. What’s new For a summary of all new features and improvements since 6.2, head to the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Dependency upgrades JDK 11 (reminder) Hibernate Search now requires Java 11 as a baseline and is no longer compatible with Java 8. Switch to Jakarta EE (reminder) Hibernate Search completely switched to Jakarta EE and is not compatible with Java EE anymore. All of -orm6 and -jakarta artifacts from the previous series that provided Hibernate ORM 6 and Jakarta EE compatibility are now unavailable since this compatibility is now provided by the main artifacts. Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-4959) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.3.1.Final. Lucene (HSEARCH-4982) The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.8. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-4946) The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.10 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for the following versions whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life: 5.x/6.x (compatibility already dropped in Hibernate Search 7.0.0.Beta1) 7.0-7.9 (newly dropped in HSEARCH-4934) OpenSearch (HSEARCH-4978/HSEARCH-4993) The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.10 and 2.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 whose compatibility was dropped in HSEARCH-4934, because they already reached their end of life. Others HSEARCH-4941/HSEARCH-4946/HSEARCH-4958/HSEARCH-4967/HSEARCH-4990/HSEARCH-4994: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.10.4 HSEARCH-4957 Upgrade to Jackson 2.15.2 HSEARCH-4984 Upgrade to Avro 1.11.3 HSEARCH-4992 Upgrade to AWS SDK 2.21.1 Compatibility with Hibernate ORM’s discriminator-based multi-tenancy With HSEARCH-4403, Hibernate Search can now index Hibernate ORM entities that take advantage of discriminator-based multi-tenancy in the database (@TenandId). Maven artifact renamings Some Hibernate Search Maven artifacts have been renamed: HSEARCH-4940 Maven artifacts related to JSR-352 artifacts were renamed to reflect the move to the Jakarta EE specification: hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-core. hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-jberet was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-jberet. HSEARCH-4928 The artifact hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-outbox-polling. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4938: The complement operator (~) in regexp predicates is no longer supported. HSEARCH-4947: Hibernate Search will no longer fail to boot on Windows in some setups. Thanks to Gábor Lipták for reporting this and helping test the fix! HSEARCH-4487: The Jakarta Batch Mass Indexing job has been redesigned to mirror more closely the behavior of the MassIndexer. As a result, it will no longer fail when indexing entities containing a @IndexedEmbedded and using MySQL with an idFetchSize set to Integer.MIN_VALUE. Thanks to Ivan Kotev for reporting this and helping identify the cause! HSEARCH-4980: Hibernate Search will no longer fail when trying to index entities with composite identifiers in the Jakarta Batch Mass Indexing job. HSEARCH-4969: Fixed a bug caused by a mistake in the Lucene 9 upgrade, where TextMultiValues would trigger an IndexOutOfBoundsException. HSEARCH-4983: Fixed a potential concurrency issue in the Lucene backend that could lead to "`LockObtainFailedException`: Lock held by this virtual machine". HSEARCH-4986: The Jakarta Batch Mass Indexing job will no longer fail in the partition mapping stage for some JDBC drivers (DB2, MSSQL, …). HSEARCH-4988: Hibernate Search will no longer fail on startup with a StackOverflowError when mapping types that are containers of their own type, such as java.nio.Path which implements Iterable<Path>. Attempting to use default container extraction on such types will fail with a clear explanation, and disabling container extraction or otherwise resolving the infinite recursion will work as expected. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marco Belladelli', 'Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: 6.2.3.Final. What’s new This release includes several bug fixes and small performance improvements. Hibernate Spatial PostGIS distance operators We have added HQL support for the native PostGIS distance operators. For details, see HHH-15160. Bugfixes Refresh operations We have fixed a couple of issues related to the refresh operation: An error was triggered when calling refresh on an entity with both lazy and eager associations (see HHH-16423). The lazy loading of associated collections failed after calling refresh on an entity (see HHH-16447). Associated collection loading We have fixed several bugs related to loading an entity’s associated collections: Loading an Entity with two eager collections produced duplicates if one of the collection is a bag (see HHH-16453). Multiple identical SELECT statements were issues to load an optional one-to-one association (see HHH-16469). Treated paths and entity types We have improved Hibernate’s handling of treated entity types. Previously, in some cases, we were creating too restrictive queries for certain inheritance structures and treated paths. With this new logic we should always guarantee correct results while also gaining improved query optimization and performance (see HHH-15726). Generics We continue to improve support for Java Generics: we added handling for generic component properties (i.e. @Embedded and @EmbeddedId) that will allow the use of Generics while being consistent with the JPA specification and providing correct results (see HHH-16491).

Hibernate Search 7.0 also brings new features such as a brand-new Hibernate Search BOM, experimental compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, compatibility with Hibernate ORM’s discriminator-based multi-tenancy, and other bugfixes and improvements. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 6.2 Java Hibernate Search is now using JDK 11 as a baseline and can work on JDK 11, 17 or 21. Compatibility with JDK 8 was dropped. Hibernate ORM Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4 as it fully switched to Jakarta EE. There are no -orm6/-jakarta artifacts or Java EE compatibility anymore. Lucene The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.8. Upgrading requires reindexing, see the migration guide for details. Elasticsearch The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.10/8.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for the following versions whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life: 5.x/6.x 7.0-7.9 OpenSearch The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.10 and 2.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life. Hibernate Search BOM Hibernate Search now offers a BOM providing dependency management for all of its published artifacts. It can be imported as part of your dependency management to keep the versions of Hibernate Search artifacts aligned: <dependencyManagement> <dependencies> <!-- Import Hibernate Search BOM to get all of its artifact versions aligned: --> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-bom</artifactId> <version>7.0.0.Final</version> <type>pom</type> <scope>import</scope> </dependency> <!-- Any other dependency management entries --> </dependencies> </dependencyManagement> <!-- ... --> <dependencies> <!-- Declare dependencies --> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-mapper-orm</artifactId> <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above --> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch</artifactId> <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above --> </dependency> <!-- Any other dependency entries --> </dependencies> Amazon OpenSearch Serverless experimental compatibility Hibernate Search now has incubating compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. Amazon OpenSearch Serverless has certain limitations compared to a regular OpenSearch cluster and may not support all operations a regular cluster does. Compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless must be enabled explicitly by setting the backend version property: hibernate.search.backend.version=amazon-opensearch-serverless See this section of the reference documentation for more information, in particular about limitations. Compatibility with Hibernate ORM’s discriminator-based multi-tenancy Hibernate Search can now index Hibernate ORM entities that take advantage of discriminator-based multi-tenancy in the database (@TenandId). Maven artifact renamings Some Hibernate Search Maven artifacts have been renamed: Maven artifacts related to JSR-352 artifacts were renamed to reflect the move to the Jakarta EE specification: hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-core. hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-jberet was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-jberet.

Supported database versions For a long time, Hibernate kept around code for supporting database versions that are now considered ancient. It wasn’t always clear what the minimum database version is that is supposed to be supported and there was no continuous testing against old or the latest version of a database. The Hibernate team tried to support database versions on a best effort basis. With Hibernate 6.0 the team wanted to do better and by making sure we commit ourselves to a certain set of DBs, and move dialects for other DBs into a new module, called hibernate-community-dialects. We provided clear requirements for vendors on how to get their dialects to hibernate-core. Another thing that changed with Hibernate 6.0 is that dialects can now self-configure based on the database version, which eliminated the need for the various version specific dialects. There was still some overhead for dialect maintenance due to code that was trying to emulate certain functions or SQL constructs for ancient database versions. Since the Hibernate team is relatively small when considering the size of the project, we decided to clarify the supported set of databases in version 6.2 by also specifying versions which are supported. Doing so will make it easily understandable for users what Hibernate supports and what not. Additionally, it allows us to get rid of some code which makes maintenance easier. As of version 6.2, every dialect will have a "minimum supported version" attached, and during self-configuration of the dialect, it will check if the database version is greater or equal to that. If it isn’t, Hibernate emits a warning. Dialects that support even older database versions were moved to the hibernate-community-dialects module and are only updated on a best effort basis. In general, Hibernate ties its database version support to the support cycle of the respective vendor. Minor versions of Hibernate might drop support for database versions that have become unsupported. The list of version support changes for Hibernate 6.2 can be nicely seen on HHH-15175 Outlook Hibernate 6.3 will be the next minor version and as part of that, support for some more database versions will be dropped. The list of planned version support changes can be seen on HHH-15491. I hope that this insight into the process of database version support is not a shocker to anyone.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Christian Beikov', 'Hibernate ORM version 6.2.0.Final is around the corner, and the following post tries to shed some light on one of the new features that comes with that release. Table partitioning In data management, it is sometimes necessary to split data of a table into various (physical) partitions, based on partition keys and a partitioning scheme. Every database has a different way of defining the partitioning keys and scheme for a table, but something that all of them have in common is the fact that the query planner needs to decide which partition to look into for a query. Unless the database supports globally unique indexes on partitioned tables, the query planner can’t know which partition it must target, and hence will have to plan to access every partition. This unfortunately leads to poor query planning performance on the popular open source databases PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB, which support partitioning but not globally unique indexes on partitioned tables. Partition Key Mapping After some discussions about how this could be supported in Hibernate, we went with a minimal approach first, to make sure we can help people improve their performance as soon as possible. The minimal approach is to allow marking persistent attributes to be part of the partition key, by annotating @PartitionKey. This has the effect that SQL update and delete statements, which are issued by Hibernate when flushing entity state changes, will additionally restrict the partition key columns in WHERE clause predicate. Consider the following entity model: @Entity @Table(name = "user_tbl") public static class User { @Id private Long id; private String firstname; private String lastname; @PartitionKey private String tenantKey; } When updating or deleting such an entity, Hibernate will now generate SQL similar to this: update user_tbl set firstname=?,lastname=?,tenantKey=? where id=? and tenantKey=? delete from user_tbl where id=? and tenantKey=? The presence of a restriction in the WHERE clause predicate allows the planner to take a peek at the parameter value and immediately prune tables that don’t fit the partition key. Outlook So far, Hibernate only makes use of the partitioning information in SQL update and delete statements. There were discussions about adding support for DDL generation as well, but nothing has been agreed upon yet. Do you think you could profit from DDL support? If so, let us know about your use case in the comments of the GitHub discussion.', 'Hibernate ORM 6.2 - Partitioning support', 'https://in.relation.to/2023/02/08/hibernate-orm-62-partitioning/', null);

Compared to Hibernate Search 7.0, this release introduces vector search capabilities, allows looking up the capabilities of each field in the metamodel, adds a new query string predicate, simplifies the entity registration in the Standalone POJO mapper, brings compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.12 and OpenSearch 2.12, upgrades to Lucene 9.9, and brings other bugfixes and improvements. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 7.0 Dependency upgrades Lucene The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.9. Besides other improvements it brings better vector search performance. Elasticsearch The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.12 as well as other versions that were already compatible. OpenSearch The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.12 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Vector search for Lucene and Elasticsearch Backends Hibernate Search now allows vector search in Lucene and Elasticsearch backends as an incubating feature. Vector search provides the tools to search over binary (images, audio or video) or text data: external tools convert that data to vectors (arrays of bytes or floats, also called "embeddings"), which are then used for indexing and queries in Hibernate Search. Hibernate Search introduces a new field type — @VectorField and a new predicate knn, so that the vectors can be indexed and then searched upon. Vector fields can work with vector data represented as byte or float arrays in the documents. Out of the box byte[] and float[] property types will work with the new field type. For any other entity property types, a custom value bridge or value binder should be implemented. Keep in mind that indexed vectors must be of the same length and that this length should be specified upfront for the schema to be created: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @VectorField(dimension = 512) private float[] coverImageEmbeddings; // Other properties ... } Searching for vector similarities is performed via a knn predicate: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // provide the number of similar documents to look for: f.knn( 5 ) // the name of the vector field: .field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ) // matched documents will be the ones whose indexed vector // is "most similar" to this vector .matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) // additionally an optional filter can be supplied // to provide a regular fulltext search predicate .filter( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ).matching( "arthur" ) ) ).fetchHits( 20 ); Note that each backend may have its own specifics and limitations with regard to the vector search. For more details look at the related documentation. Looking up the capabilities of each field in the metamodel It is now possible to see which capabilities (predicates/sorts/projections/etc.) are available for a field when inspecting the metamodel: SearchMapping mapping = /*...*/ ; // Retrieve a SearchIndexedEntity: SearchIndexedEntity<Book> bookEntity = mapping.indexedEntity( Book.class ); // Get the descriptor for that index. // The descriptor exposes the index metamodel: IndexDescriptor indexDescriptor = bookEntity.indexManager().descriptor(); // Retrieve a field by name // and inspect its capabilities if such field is present: indexDescriptor.field( "releaseDate" ).ifPresent( field -> { if ( field.isValueField() ) { // Get the descriptor for the field type: IndexValueFieldTypeDescriptor type = field.toValueField().type(); // Inspect the "traits" of a field type: // each trait represents a predicate/sort/projection/aggregation // that can be used on fields of that type. Set<String> traits = type.traits(); if ( traits.contains( IndexFieldTraits.Aggregations.RANGE ) ) { // ... } if ( traits.contains( IndexFieldTraits.Predicates.EXISTS ) ) { // ... } // ... } } ); Query string predicate The queryString predicate matches documents according to a structured query given as a string. It allows building more advanced query strings (using Lucene’s query language) and has more configuration options than a simpleQueryString predicate. List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.queryString().field( "description" ) .matching( "robots +(crime investigation disappearance)^10 +\"investigation help\"~2 -/(dis)?a[p]+ea?ance/" ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The query string, in this predicate, will result in a boolean query with 4 clauses: a should clause matching robots; two must clauses another boolean query constructed from (crime || investigation || disappearance) string with a boost of 10 a query matching the phrase investigation help with the phrase slop equals to 2 a must not clause matching a regular expression (dis)?a[p]+ea?ance Note that each of the mentioned clauses may itself end up being translated into other types of queries. See this section of the reference documentation on the queryString predicate for more information. Simpler entity registration in the Standalone POJO mapper Hibernate Search simplifies how entities can be defined. For standalone mapper now it is enough to annotate your entities with the @SearchEntity annotation. @SearchEntity (1) // ... Other annotations, e.g. @Indexed if this entity needs to be mapped to an index. public class Book { @Id private Integer id; // Other properties ... } 1 Annotate the type with @SearchEntity so it is treated as an entity. Another update related to this is a way the SearchMappingBuilder builder is created. Now it requires an annotated type source to be provided. CloseableSearchMapping searchMapping = SearchMapping.builder( AnnotatedTypeSource.fromClasses( (1) Book.class, Associate.class, Manager.class )) .property( "hibernate.search.backend.hosts", "elasticsearch.mycompany.com" ) (2) // ... .build(); (3) 1 Create a builder, passing an AnnotatedTypeSource to let Hibernate Search know where to look for annotations. Thanks to classpath scanning, your AnnotatedTypeSource only needs to include one class from each JAR containing annotated types. Other types should be automatically discovered. 2 Set additional configuration properties. 3 Build the SearchMapping. See this section of the reference documentation on the entity definition for more information. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 7.0.0.CR1 HSEARCH-5083: Upgrade to AWS SDK 2.24.1.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Steve Ebersole', 'Hibernate ORM 6.2.0 Final has just been released. In many ways, this release marks the final step for the major forcus of 6.x centered around changing how Hibernate generates SQL. Many improvements in this release, as well as 6.0 and 6.1, have been implemented on top of this SQL AST work. As of 6.0 and 6.1, Hibernate used this SQL AST for loading state from the database. With 6.2, Hibernate also uses SQL AST for writing to the database. Support for Structured SQL Types Hibernate now supports structured SQL types including struct, XML and JSON. Christian wrote a blog post about this support which covers the details. See also the Aggregate embeddable mapping and @Struct aggregate embeddable mapping User Guide sections. Support for Java records Hibernate now support the mapping of Java records as embeddables. E.g. @Embeddable public record Name( String firstName; String lastName; ) {} even combined with Support for Structured SQL Types to persist to a struct! @Embeddable @Struct(name = "Name") public record Name( String firstName; String lastName; ) {} See the @Struct aggregate embeddable mapping User Guide section for more details. Unified generated value support Support for generated persisted values has been has been unified to use the same contracts, whether for identifiers or other basic values, based on org.hibernate.annotations.Generated, org.hibernate.annotations.ValueGenerationType and org.hibernate.generator.Generator. E.g. @Generated( GenerationTime.INSERT ) @ColumnDefault( "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" ) private Date createdDate; or @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target( { ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE } ) @ValueGenerationType( generatedBy = UuidValueGeneration.class ) public @interface GeneratedUuidValue { GenerationTiming timing(); } public static class UuidValueGeneration implements BeforeExecutionGenerator {...} ... @GeneratedUuidValue( timing = GenerationTiming.INSERT ) public UUID createdUuid; See the Generated properties User Guide section for details. Database Partitions Hibernate now supports database partitions as a first-class citizen using org.hibernate.annotations.PartitionKey to map the parition column. E.g. @Entity public static class User { @Id private Integer id; ... @PartitionKey private String region; } See the Paritioning User Guide section for details. SQL MERGE for "optional table" updates Building on top of the SQL AST, Hibernate can now use the SQL MERGE command to handle updates against optional tables. An update to an optional table will have one of 3 ultimate outcomes: if there is no corresponding row already in the table, insert the row else if all the new "value" columns are null, delete the row else update the row The legacy behavior was to just do these if-checks ourselves at runtime and execute the insert, update and delete statements individually. The MERGE command allows that to happen more efficiently in a single JDBC call. Currently this is supported on: H2 Oracle SQL Server PostgreSQL The fall back is to just use the legacy behavior. Proprietary SQL types Dealing with certain SQL types requires access to JDBC driver specific classes in order to properly read and write values of that type. In some environments (various containers, e.g.), those classes are not available to Hibernate. Hibernate better handles these situations now when it can, usually based on casts to more standardized types. For example, we might read a JSON value from a ResultSet as a String by wrapping the JSON expression in a cast function.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Christian Beikov', 'Hibernate ORM version 6.2.0.Final is around the corner, and the following post tries to shed some light on one of the new features that comes with that release. With clause The with clause was introduced in SQL:1999 and allows to specify common table expressions (CTEs), which can be imagined like named subqueries. Every uncorrelated subquery can be factored to a CTE in the with clause. The semantics are equivalent. The with clause offers features beyond naming subqueries though: Specify materialization hints Recursive querying The most important part of CTEs is the support for recursive querying that allows to query hierarchies or graphs of data. Hibernate chose to support the same syntax as the SQL standard, though there are some differences: No need for the recursive keyword - Hibernate infers that information Specifying cte attribute names has to be done through select item aliases. Names in the CTE header are not allowed queryExpression : withClause? orderedQuery (setOperator orderedQuery)* ; withClause : "WITH" cte ("," cte)* ; cte : identifier AS ("NOT"? "MATERIALIZED")? "(" queryExpression ")" searchClause? cycleClause? ; Materialization hint The materialization hint MATERIALIZED or NOT MATERIALIZED can be applied to tell the DBMS whether a CTE should or shouldn’t be materialized. Consult the database manual of the respective database for the exact meaning of the hint. Usually, one can expect that MATERIALIZED will cause the subquery to be executed separately and saved into a temporary table, whereas NOT MATERIALIZED will cause the subquery to be inlined into every use site and considered during optimizations separately. with data as materialized( select p.person as owner, c.payment is not null as payed from Call c join c.phone p where p.number = :phoneNumber ) select d.owner, d.payed from data d Recursive querying The main use case for the with clause is to define a name for a subquery, such that this subquery can refer to itself, which ultimately enables recursive querying. Recursive CTEs must follow a very particular shape, which is Base query part union or union all Recursive query part with paymentConnectedPersons as( -- Base query part select a.owner owner from Account a where a.id = :startId -- union or union all union all -- Recursive query part select a2.owner owner from paymentConnectedPersons d join Account a on a.owner = d.owner join a.payments p join Account a2 on a2.owner = p.person ) select d.owner from paymentConnectedPersons d The base query part represents the initial set of rows. When fetching a tree of data, the base query part usually is the tree root. The recursive query part is executed again and again until it produces no new rows. The result of such a CTE is the base query part result unioned together with all recursive query part executions. Depending on whether union all or union (distinct) is used, duplicate rows are preserved or not. Recursive queries additionally can have a search clause to hint the DBMS whether to use breadth or depth first searching a cycle clause to hint the DBMS how to determine that a cycle was reached Defining the search clause requires specifying a name for an attribute in the set sub-clause, that will be added to the CTE type and allows ordering results according to the search order. searchClause : "SEARCH" ("BREADTH"|"DEPTH") "FIRST BY" searchSpecifications "SET" identifier ; searchSpecifications : searchSpecification ("," searchSpecification)* ; searchSpecification : identifier sortDirection? nullsPrecedence? ; A DBMS has two possible orders when executing the recursive query part Depth first - handle the newest produced rows by the recursive query part first Breadth first - handle the oldest produced rows by the recursive query part first with paymentConnectedPersons as( select a.owner owner from Account a where a.id = :startId union all select a2.owner owner from paymentConnectedPersons d join Account a on a.owner = d.owner join a.payments p join Account a2 on a2.owner = p.person ) search breadth first by owner set orderAttr select d.owner from paymentConnectedPersons d Recursive processing can lead to cycles which might lead to queries executing forever. The cycle clause hints the DBMS which CTE attributes to track for the cycle detection. It requires specifying a name for a cycle mark attribute in the set sub-clause, that will be added to the CTE type and allows detecting if a cycle occurred for a result. By default, the cycle mark attribute will be set to true when a cycle is detected and false otherwise. The values to use can be explicitly specified through the to and default sub-clauses. Optionally, it’s also possible to specify a cycle path attribute name through the using clause The cycle path attribute can be used to understand the traversal path that lead to a result. cycleClause : "CYCLE" cteAttributes "SET" identifier ("TO" literal "DEFAULT" literal)? ("USING" identifier)? ; with paymentConnectedPersons as( select a.owner owner from Account a where a.id = :startId union all select a2.owner owner from paymentConnectedPersons d join Account a on a.owner = d.owner join a.payments p join Account a2 on a2.owner = p.person ) cycle owner set cycleMark select d.owner, d.cycleMark from paymentConnectedPersons d Hibernate merely translates recursive CTEs but doesn’t attempt to emulate the feature. Therefore, this feature will only work if the database supports recursive CTEs. Hibernate does emulate the search and cycle clauses though if necessary, so you can safely use that. Note that most modern database versions support recursive CTEs already. Outlook This was a long awaited feature as you can tell from the issue number HHH-4030, so it’s great that Hibernate finally supports the with clause. You might think that we are already done with this, but there is still a nice little addition to recursive querying that can be made. We are currently discussing support for a recursive join fetch feature which would make fetching data trees a lot simpler.

-- INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marko Bekhta', 'We just published Hibernate Search 7.1.0.Alpha1, a first alpha release of the next major version of Hibernate Search. This version opens up possibilities for searching over binary (image, audio or video) data using vector search. Beyond that, it improves Hibernate Search compatibility with other frameworks. What’s new Hibernate Search 7.1 is still in its early stages of development: some features are still incomplete or may change in a backward-incompatible way. Vector search for the Lucene Backend Hibernate Search now allows vector search in the Lucene backend as an incubating feature. Vector search provides the tools to search over binary (images, audio or video) or text data: external tools convert that data to vectors (arrays of bytes or floats, also called "embeddings"), which are then used for indexing and queries in Hibernate Search. Hibernate Search introduces a new field type — @VectorField and a new predicate knn, so that the vectors can be indexed and then searched upon. Vector fields can work with vector data represented as byte or float arrays in the documents. Out of the box byte[] and float[] property types will work with the new field type. For any other entity property types, a custom value bridge or value binder should be implemented. Keep in mind that indexed vectors must be of the same length and that this length should be specified upfront for the schema to be created: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @VectorField(dimension = 512) private float[] coverImageEmbeddings; // Other properties ... } Searching for vector similarities is performed via a knn predicate: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // provide the number of similar documents to look for: f.knn( 5 ) // the name of the vector field: .field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ) // matched documents will be the ones whose indexed vector // is "most similar" to this vector .matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) // additionally an optional filter can be supplied // to provide a regular fulltext search predicate .filter( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ).matching( "arthur" ) ) ).fetchHits( 20 ); See this section of the reference documentation on vector fields and the one on a new knn predicate for more information.

What’s new This release includes several bug fixes and small performance improvements. Bugfixes Sub-queries using aliases and left joins We have improved the resolution of tables in sub-queries, especially in cases where the same alias was also used in the parent query. This change also fixed a bug that caused left-joins in sub-queries to be wrongly translated (see HHH-16414). Batching We have fixed a few issues related to batching: a parameter binding error was thrown when using DynamicUpdate or DynamicInserts with batching enabled (see HHH-16352). an OptimisticLockException was thrown when an entity having a Version attribute and a dirty collection was updated with statement batching enabled (see HHH-15778). You can expect more improvements related to batching in the following Hibernate releases. Bytecode enhancement and dirty checking We have fixed a bug causing generic associations to be ignored when dirty checking and bytecode enhancement were enabled (see HHH-16459). Composite primary key querying We have fixed a bug causing part of a composite @IdClass primary key not to be returned when querying (see HHH-16387). Internal nullness marking and checking We started the internal process of reviewing the code base and adding nullness annotations which will be automatically verified thanks to the Checker Framework (see HHH-16389).

Batch loading In previous 6.2 versions the batch loading feature was improved several times. With this release we keep stabilizing it by fixing a couple issues: In-clause parameter padding did not consider the Dialect’s in-expression count limit which could cause errors on the DMBS side (see HHH-16589) When batching was enabled the LockModeType requested through the session.find() method was ignored (see HHH-16820) There are more improvements and bugfixes included in this version.

Soft Delete 6.4 adds support for soft deletes using the new @SoftDelete annotation. @Entity @SoftDelete class Account { ... } Dealing with values as deleted/non-deleted versus active/inactive (reversed) is simple using an annotation attribute: @Entity @SoftDelete(strategy=ACTIVE) class Account { ... } It even supports pluggable converters for dealing with what gets stored in the database. See the User Guide for details. HQL/Criteria Array Functions Following up on earlier work, 6.4 adds the remaining functions for handling arrays in HQL and Criteria queries, including - array() Creates an array based on the passed arguments - e.g. array(1,2,3) array_position() Determines the position of an element in an array - e.g. where array_position(an.array,''x'') = 1 array_length() Determines the length of an array - e.g. where array_length(an.array) > 50 array_get() Accesses the element of an array by index - e.g. where array_get(an.array, 1) <> 13 array_slice() Creates a sub-array of the given array based on lower and upper index - e.g. array_slice(an.array,3,6) array_contains() Whether an array contains an element - e.g. array_contains(an.array, 1) And others… See the Query Guide for excellent coverage of these functions. These functions are still incubating and some things (names, etc) may change before Final. Java Flight Recorder Events CR1 contains support for producing a small number of Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events as a proof of concept. This works on many JDKs, but we recently discovered that not all JDKs support the JFR package despite being part of Open JDK.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Christian Beikov', 'Hibernate ORM version 6.2.0.Final is around the corner, and the following post tries to shed some light on one of the new features that comes with that release. Composite SQL types For a long time, SQL was fully relational and every data model had to be modeled as table with columns and constraints. Then came the object relational hype and the SQL:1999 standard introduced support for structured types. With the XML hype coming next, the SQL:2003 standard added support for XML and in the SQL:2016 standard JSON support first appeared. Structured or unstructured, composite types have their use cases, so it was about time that Hibernate came up with an answer for these data types. Values of these composite types provide access to their sub-parts and do not have identity like a row of a table. In the realm of ORM, embeddable types have the same properties, so it is only natural to allow mapping to these SQL types. Struct mapping Mapping an embeddable to a named SQL object type, also known as structured type, is now possible by annotating either the embeddable type or the @Embedded field/property with @Struct(name = "…"). The hbm2ddl schema generation tool supports generating DDL to create and drop these structured types. Since the order of structured type attributes is important and has to match the expectations of Hibernate, users can compare the type definition until schema validation adds support for structured types as well. Considering this simple example mapping: @Embeddable @Struct(name = "my_point") public class Point { private int x; private int y; } will produce a schema similar to the following: create type my_point as ( x int not null, y int not null ) The name and the nullability of the struct column can be refined through applying a @Column on the persistent attribute. @Entity public class PointHolder { @Id private int id; @Column(name = "the_point", nullable = false) private Point p; } which will emit a schema similar to this: create table PointHolder as ( id int not null primary key, the_point my_point not null ) Since the order of structured type attributes is vital, it is important to understand how to control the expectations of Hibernate. There are essentially two possible ways to control the order: Specifying the attributes member on the @Struct annotation to define the order Using a Java record to implicitly specify the order through the canonical constructor The first option is pretty simple. If the desired order is (y,x), then the Point embeddable type needs to declare that by using @Struct(name = "my_point", attributes = {"y", "x"}). The second option is more interesting as it makes use of another new feature that was introduced in Hibernate 6.2, which is the support for Java records out of the box. @Embeddable @Struct(name = "my_point") public record Point(int y, int x) {} There is no need for the @EmbeddableInstantiator anymore for Java records, because Hibernate now configures an appropriate instantiator automatically based on the canonical constructor. The order of the record components in that canonical constructor then also represents the order in which Hibernate expects the structured types attributes to be defined in. At the time of writing, structured type support is only implemented for Oracle, PostgreSQL and DB2. XML and JSON mapping Since XML and JSON are predefined unstructured types, there is no type name or attribute order that has to be defined. Mapping an embeddable as XML or JSON can be done by annotating the @Embedded field/property with @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.SQLXML) or @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON) respectively. At the time of writing, there is no database dialect for which XML support has been implemented, so the following will focus on the JSON parts only, but apply the same way to XML support in the future. @Entity public class JsonHolder { @Id private int id; @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON) @Column(name = "my_json", nullable = false) private Point point; } An entity with a mapping like this will roughly produce a schema like the following: create table JsonHolder as ( id int not null primary key, my_json json not null, check (json_value(my_json, ''$.x'') is not null and json_value(my_json, ''$.y'') is not null) ) As you can see, the table definition contains a check constraint that enforces the constraints of the embeddable type within the JSON value by accessing the fields through the json_value function. HQL queries that make use of embeddable attributes select j.point.x, j.point.y from JsonHolder j will resolve to the respective json_value expression: select json_value(j.point, ''$.x''), json_value(j.point, ''$.y'') from JsonHolder j Similarly, assignment expressions will update the relevant part of the json document. At the time of writing, JSON support is only implemented for Oracle and PostgreSQL. Outlook In upcoming releases we plan to add support for struct types on SQL Server, as well as support for other databases for the XML and JSON mappings. We will also try to lift restrictions on composite type mappings and enable the use of association mappings as well as array mappings.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We just published Hibernate Search 6.2.0.Alpha2, an alpha release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search. This version brings simpler and/or/not predicates, mass indexing for multiple tenants, and a switch to UUIDs for identifiers in the outbox-polling coordination strategy. 6.2.0.Alpha2 also includes many bugfixes and improvements, compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.6 and OpenSearch 2.5, an upgrade of -orm6 artifacts to Hibernate ORM 6.2.0.CR2, and more. Thanks Thanks to Yannis Bres for his work on AND/OR predicates. What’s new Hibernate Search 6.2 is still in development: some features are still incomplete or may change in a backward-incompatible way. Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-4747/HSEARCH-4791) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 5.6.14.Final, or Hibernate ORM 6.2.0.CR2 for -orm6 artifacts. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-4777) The Elasticsearch backend now works with Elasticsearch 8.6 as well as other versions that were already compatible. OpenSearch (HSEARCH-4790) The Elasticsearch backend now works with OpenSearch 2.5 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-4793: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.6.1 HSEARCH-4659: Upgrade to Avro 1.11.1 HSEARCH-4660: Upgrade to GSON 2.9.1 HSEARCH-4661: Upgrade to JBeret 1.4.8.Final HSEARCH-4697: Upgrade to Jackson 2.13.4 HSEARCH-4739: Upgrade to jackson-databind 2.13.4.2 HSEARCH-4694: Compatibility with Jandex 3.0 HSEARCH-4798: Upgrade to AWS SDK 2.20.2 Standalone POJO Mapper The Standalone POJO Mapper enables mapping arbitrary POJOs to indexes, even without Hibernate ORM. See this section of the reference documentation for more information, or this getting started guide. In this release, there were several improvements to the configuration of the Standalone POJO mapper: HSEARCH-4615: More configuration is set simply through configuration properties. HSEARCH-4620: Indexing plan synchronization is now configured through strategies, just like with the ORM mapper. Mapping index content to custom types (projection constructors) In a previous release, Hibernate Search 6.2 introduced the ability to define projections through the mapping of custom types (typically records), by applying the @ProjectionConstructor annotation to those types or their constructor. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. In this release, there were several improvements to the projection constructors: HSEARCH-4579: With the Standalone POJO Mapper, when searching on an entity type with no loading configured, Hibernate Search will now attempt to use that entity type’s projection constructor if it exists. HSEARCH-4591: Object projections are now allowed on single-valued, flattened object fields with the Lucene backend. HSEARCH-4669: Hibernate Search will provide more information when a projection constructor cannot be applied to an index. HSEARCH-4673: The -parameters compiler flag is no longer necessary when using the default constructor of records as projection constructor. Mapping improvements HSEARCH-4714: Property names in the mapping, e.g. @IndexingDependency(derivedFrom = …), will now be checked early to provide a clear error message in case of incorrect syntax. HSEARCH-4782: Hibernate Search will now infer a default decimal scale automatically for identifiers of Hibernate ORM entities; previously it was only inferred for non-identifier properties. Search DSL improvements Simpler boolean operators with the and/or/not predicates (HSEARCH-4601/HSEARCH-4645) For simpler use cases, you can now avoid the rather complex bool predicate and use the new and/or/not predicates instead: List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.and( f.match().field( "title" ) .matching( "robot" ), f.match().field( "description" ) .matching( "crime" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.or( f.match().field( "title" ) .matching( "robot" ), f.match().field( "description" ) .matching( "investigation" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.not( f.match() .field( "genre" ) .matching( Genre.SCIENCE_FICTION ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Simpler and predicate for where( (f, b) → … ) (HSEARCH-4676) Instead of a bool predicate` as in 6.2.0.Alpha1, where( (f, b) → … ) now provides a simpler and predicate: MySearchParameters searchParameters = getSearchParameters(); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( (f, root) -> { root.add( f.matchAll() ); if ( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.match().field( "genre" ) .matching( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() ) ); } if ( searchParameters.getFullTextFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.match().fields( "title", "description" ) .matching( searchParameters.getFullTextFilter() ) ); } if ( searchParameters.getPageCountMaxFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.range().field( "pageCount" ) .atMost( searchParameters.getPageCountMaxFilter() ) ); } } ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Simpler and predicate for the nested predicate (HSEARCH-4676) Instead of a bool predicate` as in as in 6.2.0.Alpha1 6.2.0.Alpha1, f.nested( … ) now provides a simpler and predicate: List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.nested( "authors" ) .add( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ) .matching( "isaac" ) ) .add( f.match().field( "authors.lastName" ) .matching( "asimov" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Mass indexing improvements Mass indexing multiple tenants (HSEARCH-4321) In multi-tenant applications, mass indexing can now handle multiple tenants at once, provided you don’t pass any tenant identifier when creating the mass indexer, and you provided a list of tenants in the Hibernate Search configuration. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Setting up thread locals during mass indexing (HSEARCH-1809) The mass indexer now has a concept of "mass indexing environment", allowing for instance to set up custom thread locals in mass indexing threads. See the environment parameter in this section of the reference documentation for more information. Better exception handling (HSEARCH-4541) Exceptions thrown by Hibernate ORM during mass indexing are now passed to the failure handler as every other exception, instead of aborting the whole mass indexing. Smarter defaults for parameters (HSEARCH-4612) purgeAllOnStart is now disabled by default in the mass indexer when dropAndCreateSchemaOnStart is enabled. outbox-polling coordination improvements Outbox events and agents now use UUIDs for their identifiers (HSEARCH-4678/HSEARCH-4748) The primary key of the relevant tables are now using UUIDs instead of longs, to avoid reliance on sequences that were slowing down event processing on some databases. The migration guide includes migration scripts for the necessary database schema changes. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4618: BooleanPredicateOptionsCollector/SimpleBooleanPredicateClausesCollector now expose a hasClause() method. HSEARCH-4294: The Search DSL now allows targeting "implicit" Elasticsearch fields such as _index. HSEARCH-4644: Hibernate Search is now tested regularly against CockroachDB. HSEARCH-4679: Hibernate Search will now automatically simplify boolean predicates with a single clause. HSEARCH-4305, HSEARCH-4708: Automatic reindexing will no longer be skipped when changing a property annotated with @OneToOne(mappedBy = …) @IndexedEmbedded HSEARCH-4727: With outbox-polling coordination and when using DB2, OutboxEvent table used to be created with a payload column with the wrong type blob(255), making it almost unusable. It is no longer the case. HSEARCH-4634, HSEARCH-4647: outbox-polling coordination now works with CockroachDB. HSEARCH-4652: Schema validation with the Elasticsearch backend will no longer fail when setting searchAnalyzer to the same value as analyzer on a full-text field. HSEARCH-4654: Hibernate Search will no longer deadlock when experiencing a large number of concurrent failures during startup or schema validation. HSEARCH-4701: When running Hibernate Search as a Java module (in the modulepath), Elasticsearch schema management will no longer lead to exceptions caused by missing inter-module dependencies. HSEARCH-4703: Fixed missing entries in the Java module descriptor of hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling leading to errors when running Hibernate Search in the modulepath. HSEARCH-4724: Classpath scanning (for projection constructors in particular) no longer ignores classes within Spring Boot’s "repackaged" JARs. And more.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marco Belladelli', 'Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: 6.2.5.Final. What’s new This maintenance release keeps improving stability with several bugfixes. Bugfixes Second level cache fixes We have fixed several bugs related to Hibernate’s second level cache functionalities: Caching was not working properly for entities with inheritance when hibernate.cache.use_structured_entries was enabled (see HHH-16714). Hibernate failed to access a lazy fetched @ManyToOne association which was part of a composite @IdClass identifier when stored in L2 cache (see HHH-16673). A TransientObjectException was encountered when loading a versioned entity from the second level cache with a @OneToOne lazy mapping (see HHH-16745). Treated and generic association joins We addressed a couple issues that occurred when joining on generic or treated association paths: When joining on a treated association we failed to retrieve the attribute from the correct treat target type (see HHH-16574). When joining on a MappedSuperclass generic association there was a problem recognizing the association attribute from the concrete (see HHH-16693). Mapping the same column to different properties We have fixed several issues that were reported for different use cases which had problems when mapping the same underlying database column to different model properties (see HHH-15929). Batching and composite identifiers We have fixed a couple bugs related to composite identifiers when batching was enabled: Fetching an element collection on an entity with a composite @EmbeddedId identifier failed with batch enabled (see HHH-16740). A ClassCastException was triggered when an entity with an @ElementCollection had an @EmbeddedId with just one field and batching was enabled (see HHH-16750). There are more improvements and bugfixes included in this version. You can find the full list of changes here.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Steve Ebersole', 'Hibernate ORM 6.3.0.CR1 has just been released. Simultaneously, 6.2.7 has also been released. New documentation 6.3 provides 2 new documentation guides: An introductory Hibernate 6 Guide The Hibernate Query Language synatx and feature guide Query methods Hibernate can now generate DAO-style methods for named queries as part of its JPA static metamodel generator. Take the following entity as an example: @NamedQuery(name = "#findByTitleAndType", query = "select book from Book book where book.title like :titlen and book.type = :type") @Entity public class Book { ... } When processed by the metamodel generator, we will now have the following generated into the static metamodel: class Book_ { // as normal ... public static final String QUERY_FIND_BY_TITLE_AND_TYPE = "#findByTitleAndType"; public static List<Book> findByTitleAndType(@Nonnull EntityManager entityManager, String title, Type type) { return entityManager.createNamedQuery(QUERY_FIND_BY_TITLE_AND_TYPE) .setParameter("titlePattern", title) .setParameter("type", type) .getResultList(); } } And the application can then use: List<Book> books = Book_.findByTitleAndType(entityManager, titlePattern, Type.BOOK); There are a lot of capabilities to these query methods; see the Hibernate 6 Guide for a full discussion. Finder methods Using the new @Find annotation, arbitrary methods can now be processed by the generator to create finder methods similar to query methods. interface Dao { @Find Book findBookByIsbn(String isbn); } The generator will generate: class Dao_ { public static Book findBookByIsbn(@Nonnull EntityManager entityManager, String isbn) { return entityManager.unwrap(Session.class) .byNaturalId(Book.class) .using(Book_.isbn, isbn) .load(); } } Again, there are a lot of capabilities to these finder methods; see the Hibernate 6 Guide for a full discussion.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Steve Ebersole', 'I recently enabled a number of Jira Automations which focus on closing issues which are considered stale. An issue is considered stale when A test case was requested more than 30 days ago, but one was not provided. This rule considers both Pull Requests and attachments, though not "test cases" defined in description or comments. Additional information for an incomplete report was requested more than 30 days ago, but no reponse was provided. As with any attempt at automation, there will be cases which do not fit nicely into the automation rules - both false positives and false negatives.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Steve Ebersole', 'Hibernate ORM 6.3.0 has just been released. Simultaneously, 6.2.8 has also been released. NOTE With the release of 6.3.0, 6.2 now moves into limited maintenance. Jakarta Persistence 3.2 Jakarta Persistence 3.2 is still under development, but we’ve already begun incorporating some of the changes into Hibernate. One specific change to be aware of in 6.3 is the clarification with regard to types of numeric literals in HQL/JPQL queries. You can check out the details, but the gist is - Integer - 123 Long - 123l, 123L BigInteger - 123bi, 123BI Double - 123.4 Float literal - 123.4f, 123.4F BigDecimal literal - 123.4bd, 123.4BD Notice that Hibernate’s BigInteger and BigDecimal suffix synatx has been standardized also. New documentation artifacts 2 new documentation guides have been added - An introductory Hibernate 6 Guide The Hibernate Query Language synatx and feature guide Query methods Hibernate can now generate DAO-style methods for named queries as part of its JPA static metamodel generator. Take the following entity as an example: @NamedQuery(name = "#findByTitleAndType", query = "select book from Book book where book.title like :titlePattern and book.type = :type") @Entity public class Book { ... } When processed by the metamodel generator, Hibernate adds the following into the static metamodel: class Book_ { // as normal ... public static final String QUERY_FIND_BY_TITLE_AND_TYPE = "#findByTitleAndType"; public static List<Book> findByTitleAndType(@Nonnull EntityManager entityManager, String titlePattern, Type type) { return entityManager.createNamedQuery(QUERY_FIND_BY_TITLE_AND_TYPE) .setParameter("titlePattern", titlePattern) .setParameter("type", type) .getResultList(); } } And the application can then use: List<Book> books = Book_.findByTitleAndType(entityManager, titlePattern, Type.BOOK); There are a lot of capabilities to these query methods; see the Hibernate 6 Guide for a full discussion. Finder methods Using the new @Find annotation, arbitrary methods can now be processed by the generator to create finder methods similar to query methods. interface Dao { @Find Book findBookByIsbn(String isbn); } The generator will generate: class Dao_ { public static Book findBookByIsbn(@Nonnull EntityManager entityManager, String isbn) { return entityManager.unwrap(Session.class) .byNaturalId(Book.class) .using(Book_.isbn, isbn) .load(); } } Again, there are a lot of capabilities to these finder methods; see the Hibernate 6 Guide for a full discussion. Dynamic SUBSELECT fetch support Hibernate’s SUBSELECT fetching style can now be applied dynamically using fetch profiles. E.g. @FetchProfile(name = "EagerBook") @FetchProfile(name = "EagerBookWithSubselect") @Entity class Book { ... @ManyToMany @FetchProfileOverride(profile = Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK, mode = JOIN) @FetchProfileOverride(profile = Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK_WITH_SUBSELECT, mode = SUBSELECT) Set<Author> authors; } Then, at runtime we can pick between these profiles to control how the associations are loaded - Session session = ...; session.enableFetchProfile( Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK ); // or session.enableFetchProfile( Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK_WITH_SUBSELECT ); NOTE What’s up with those Book_.PROFILE_EAGER_BOOK references? See the Hibernate 6 Guide Create Criteria from HQL 6.3 adds the abillity to create a Criteria reference from HQL - var builder = session.getFactory().getCriteriaBuilder(); var hqlCriteria = session.getFactory() .getCriteriaBuilder() .createQuery( "select id, text from Message order by received", Object[].class ); which can be mutated just like any Criteria… var root = hqlCriteria.getRootList().get(0) root.where( builder.equal( root.get(Message_.deleted), ''Y'' ) ); CriteriaDefinition utility The new CriteriaDefinition class is a utility for making it easier to work with Jakarta Persistence Criterias in many case. E.g. var query = new CriteriaDefinition<>(factory, Message.class) {{ var message = from(Message.class); where(like(message.get("text"), "hell%"), message.get("id").equalTo(1)); orderBy(asc(message.get("id"))); }}; Session session = ...; var message = session.createSelectionQuery(query).getSingleResult(); We can even use this to clean up the example from Create Criteria from HQL - var query = new CriteriaDefinition<>(factory, Object[].class, "select id, text from Message order by received") {{ var root = getRootList().get(0); where( equal( root.get(Message_.deleted), ''Y'' ); }}; StatelessSession.upsert() The new StatelessSession.upsert() method allows performing SQL-style UPSERT/MERGE operations from the Hibernate StatelessSession. // insert it ss.upsert(new Widget(1, "the nema")); // update it ss.upsert(new Widget(1, "the name")); Community For additional details, see: the Migration Guide the User Guide the Introduction Guide the release page the

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marko Bekhta', 'We just published Hibernate Search 7.0.0.Beta1, a first beta release of the next major version of Hibernate Search. The main theme of this new major version is upgrades: JDK 11 as a baseline, switch to Jakarta EE and to the latest Hibernate ORM, upgrade of the Lucene backend to the next major version (Lucene 9). Beyond that, 7.0.0.Beta1 also includes experimental compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, publishes a Hibernate Search BOM containing all of its public artifacts, and more. What’s new Hibernate Search 7.0 is still in development: some features are still incomplete or may change in a backward-incompatible way. Dependency upgrades JDK 11 (HSEARCH-4556) Hibernate Search now requires Java 11 as a baseline and is no longer compatible with Java 8. Switch to Jakarta EE (HSEARCH-4394/HSEARCH-4395/HSEARCH-4602) Hibernate Search completely switched to Jakarta EE and is not compatible with Java EE anymore. All of -orm6 and -jakarta artifacts from the previous series that provided Hibernate ORM 6 and Jakarta EE compatibility are now unavailable since this compatibility is now provided by the main artifacts. Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-4931) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.3.0.Final. Lucene (HSEARCH-4393) The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.7.0. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-4921/HSEARCH-4868) The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.9 as well as other versions that were already compatible, except the 5.x/6.x series. Compatibility with Elasticsearch 5.x/6.x is removed since these versions already reached their EOL. OpenSearch (HSEARCH-4905) The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.9 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-4921: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.9.1 HSEARCH-4602: Upgrade to CDI 4.0.1 HSEARCH-4688: Upgrade to Jandex 3.0 HSEARCH-4891: Upgrade to JBeret 2.1.2.Final HSEARCH-4896: Upgrade to Jackson 2.15.0 HSEARCH-4555: Upgrade to JBoss logging 3.5.3.Final HSEARCH-4892: Upgrade to Avro 1.11.2 Hibernate Search BOM Hibernate Search now offers a BOM providing dependency management for all of its published artifacts. It can be imported as part of your dependency management to keep the versions of Hibernate Search artifacts aligned: <dependencyManagement> <dependencies> <!-- Import Hibernate Search BOM to get all of its artifact versions aligned: --> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-bom</artifactId> <version>{hibernateSearchVersion}</version> <type>pom</type> <scope>import</scope> </dependency> <!-- Any other dependency management entries --> </dependencies> </dependencyManagement> <!-- ... --> <dependencies> <!-- Declare dependencies --> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-mapper-orm</artifactId> <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above --> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch</artifactId> <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above --> </dependency> <!-- Any other dependency entries --> </dependencies> Amazon OpenSearch Serverless experimental compatibility Hibernate Search now has incubating compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. Amazon OpenSearch Serverless has certain limitations compared to a regular OpenSearch cluster and may not support all operations a regular cluster does. Compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless must be enabled explicitly by setting the backend version property: hibernate.search.backend.version=amazon-opensearch-serverless See this section of the reference documentation for more information, in particular about limitations. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4532: Switch to Hibernate ORM 6’s LONG32VARBINARY type for payloads of outbox-polling entities. HSEARCH-4742: Allow the Standalone Pojo Mapper to read configuration properties from a file. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, assuming you were already using Hibernate Search 6.2 with -orm6 artifacts, upgrading to Hibernate Search 7.0 just requires removing the -orm6 suffix from your Hibernate Search dependencies and updating the version numbers (alternatively you can use the BOM), and of course aligning your other dependencies (e.g. Hibernate ORM), if any. Information about migration, deprecations and breaking changes is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marko Bekhta', 'We just published Hibernate Search 7.1.0.Alpha2, a second alpha release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search. This version brings more vector search capabilities and improvements as well as integrates Elasticsearch’s/OpenSearch’s vector search capabilities. What’s new Hibernate Search 7.1 is still in its early stages of development: some features are still incomplete or may change in a backward-incompatible way. Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-5060) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4.2.Final. Which brings among other things a couple of fixes to address possible issues with mass indexing when an ORM discriminator multi tenancy is in use. Lucene (HSEARCH-5043) The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.9.1. Which beyond other improvements brings better performance for vector search. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-5032) The Elasticsearch backend now is also compatible with Elasticsearch 8.12 as well as with other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-5032: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.12.0 HSEARCH-5057: Upgrade to AWS SDK 2.23.3 HSEARCH-5047: Upgrade to JBeret 2.2.0.Final Vector search for Lucene and Elasticsearch Backends This version of Hibernate Search builds on top of the previous alpha and integrates Elasticsearch/OpenSearch vector search capabilities. To recap: vector search provides the tools to search over binary (images, audio or video) or text data: external tools convert that data to vectors (arrays of bytes or floats, also called "embeddings"), which are then used for indexing and queries in Hibernate Search. Hibernate Search introduces a new field type — @VectorField and a new predicate knn, so that the vectors can be indexed and then searched upon. Vector fields can work with vector data represented as byte or float arrays in the documents. Out of the box byte[] and float[] property types will work with the new field type. For any other entity property types, a custom value bridge or value binder should be implemented. Keep in mind that indexed vectors must be of the same length and that this length should be specified upfront for the schema to be created: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @VectorField(dimension = 512) private float[] coverImageEmbeddings; // Other properties ... } Searching for vector similarities is performed via a knn predicate: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // provide the number of similar documents to look for: f.knn( 5 ) // the name of the vector field: .field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ) // matched documents will be the ones whose indexed vector // is "most similar" to this vector .matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) // additionally an optional filter can be supplied // to provide a regular fulltext search predicate .filter( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ).matching( "arthur" ) ) ).fetchHits( 20 ); By its nature a knn predicate will always try to find nearest vectors, even if the found vectors are quite far away from each other, i.e. are not that similar. This may lead to getting irrelevant results returned by the query. To address this, a knn predicate allows configuring the minimum required similarity: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // Create a knn predicate as usual: f.knn( 5 ).field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ).matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) // Specify the required minimum similarity value, to filter out irrelevant results: .requiredMinimumSimilarity( 5 ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Note that each backend may have its own specifics and limitations with regard to the vector search. For more details look at the related documentation. See this section of the reference documentation on vector fields and the one on a knn predicate for more information. This version of Hibernate Search brings some renaming related to the vector search. In particular: @VectorField#beamWidth becomes @VectorField#efConstruction as well as all related API/SPI methods (see HSEARCH-5056). @VectorField#maxConnections becomes @VectorField#m as well as all related API/SPI methods (see HSEARCH-5056). VectorSimilarity#INNER_PRODUCT becomes VectorSimilarity#DOT_PRODUCT and VectorSimilarity#MAX_INNER_PRODUCT is introduced to better align naming of vector similarity functions between backends (see HSEARCH-5038). Looking up the capabilities of each field in the metamodel It is now possible to see which capabilities (predicates/sorts/projections/etc.) are available for a field when inspecting the metamodel: SearchMapping mapping = /*...*/ ; // Retrieve a SearchIndexedEntity: SearchIndexedEntity<Book> bookEntity = mapping.indexedEntity( Book.class ); // Get the descriptor for that index. // The descriptor exposes the index metamodel: IndexDescriptor indexDescriptor = bookEntity.indexManager().descriptor(); // Retrieve a field by name // and inspect its capabilities if such field is present: indexDescriptor.field( "releaseDate" ).ifPresent( field -> { if ( field.isValueField() ) { // Get the descriptor for the field type: IndexValueFieldTypeDescriptor type = field.toValueField().type(); // Inspect the "traits" of a field type: // each trait represents a predicate/sort/projection/aggregation // that can be used on fields of that type. Set<String> traits = type.traits(); if ( traits.contains( IndexFieldTraits.Aggregations.RANGE ) ) { // ... } if ( traits.contains( IndexFieldTraits.Predicates.EXISTS ) ) { // ... } // ... } } ); Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-5034: Hibernate Search will allow passing BeanReference<? extends T> when registering beans to BeanConfigurationContext. HSEARCH-5004: Hibernate Search will default to Hibernate ORM’s defaults instead of forcing SqlTypes.CHAR for the OutboxEvent/Agent ID. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, Hibernate Search 7.1 is a drop-in replacement for 7.0, assuming you also upgrade the dependencies. Information about deprecated configuration and API is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marko Bekhta', 'We just published Hibernate Search 7.1.0.CR1, a first candidate release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search. This version brings a lot of updates and improvements for working with a Standalone POJO mapper, new query string predicate, and takes advantage of Elasticsearch 8.12 to remove some of the limitations on vector search capabilities. What’s new For a summary of all new features and improvements since 7.0, head to the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-5078) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4.4.Final. Lucene (HSEARCH-5069) The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.9.2, which brings some bug fixes related to vector search. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-5077) The Elasticsearch backend now is compatible with Elasticsearch latest 8.12.1 as well as with other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-5077: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.12.1 HSEARCH-5074: Upgrade to JBeret 2.2.1.Final knn predicate updates With the 8.12 release of Elasticsearch, a new knn query was introduced. This query is more aligned with the vector search capabilities provided by Hibernate Search, and integration with Elasticsearch was updated to use this new query. This means that previous limitations imposed on the vector search when using the Elastic distribution of the Elasticsearch backend are now removed. It also means that vector search on Elasticsearch is now only available with Elasticsearch 8.12 and later; Hibernate Search no longer supports vector search on Elasticsearch 8.11 and earlier. To remind how vector search works: for vector fields to be indexed, they should be annotated with a @VectorField annotation: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @VectorField(dimension = 512) private float[] coverImageEmbeddings; // Other properties ... } Then, searching for vector similarities is performed via a knn predicate: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // provide the number of similar documents to look for: f.knn( 5 ) // the name of the vector field: .field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ) // matched documents will be the ones whose indexed vector // is "most similar" to this vector .matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) ).fetchHits( 20 ); See this section of the reference documentation on vector fields and the one on a knn predicate for more information. Query string predicate The queryString predicate matches documents according to a structured query given as a string. It allows building more advanced query strings (using Lucene’s query language) and has more configuration options than a simpleQueryString predicate. List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.queryString().field( "description" ) .matching( "robots +(crime investigation disappearance)^10 +\"investigation help\"~2 -/(dis)?a[p]+ea?ance/" ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The query string, in this predicate, will result in a boolean query with 4 clauses: a should clause matching robots; two must clauses another boolean query constructed from (crime || investigation || disappearance) string with a boost of 10 a query matching the phrase investigation help with the phrase slop equals to 2 a must not clause matching a regular expression (dis)?a[p]+ea?ance Note that each of the mentioned clauses may itself end up being translated into other types of queries. See this section of the reference documentation on the queryString predicate for more information. Simpler entity registration in the Standalone POJO mapper Hibernate Search simplifies how entities can be defined. For standalone mapper now it is enough to annotate your entities with the @SearchEntity annotation. @SearchEntity (1) // ... Other annotations, e.g. @Indexed if this entity needs to be mapped to an index. public class Book { @Id private Integer id; // Other properties ... } 1 Annotate the type with @SearchEntity so it is treated as an entity. Another update related to this is a way the SearchMappingBuilder builder is created. Now it requires an annotated type source to be provided. CloseableSearchMapping searchMapping = SearchMapping.builder( AnnotatedTypeSource.fromClasses( (1) Book.class, Associate.class, Manager.class )) .property( "hibernate.search.backend.hosts", "elasticsearch.mycompany.com" ) (2) // ... .build(); (3) 1 Create a builder, passing an AnnotatedTypeSource to let Hibernate Search know where to look for annotations. Thanks to classpath scanning, your AnnotatedTypeSource only needs to include one class from each JAR containing annotated types. Other types should be automatically discovered. 2 Set additional configuration properties. 3 Build the SearchMapping. See this section of the reference documentation on the entity definition for more information. Targeting entities by name in the Standalone POJO Mapper The standalone POJO mapper adds a new way, previously available for Hibernate ORM integration only, for creating a search scope from type names. The type name for the standalone POJO mapper is the name used when registering an entity, be it via the @SearchEntity(name=…) annotation or through the programmatic definition using .searchEntity(). SearchMapping searchMapping = /* ... */ (1) SearchScope<Book> bookScope = searchMapping.scope( Book.class ); (2) SearchScope<Person> personSubTypesScope = searchMapping.scope( Person.class, List.of( "Manager", "Associate" ) ); (3) 1 Retrieve the SearchMapping. 2 Create a SearchScope targeting only the Book entity type using a class. 3 Create a SearchScope targeting only the Manager and Associate subtypes using their entity names. See this section of the reference documentation on the ways to create search scope for more information. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-5020: Hibernate Search increases the maximum allowed vector dimension for a Lucene backend to 4096 to allow indexing longer vectors produced by some models. HSEARCH-5073: Hibernate Search now allows specifying a minimum-should-match parameter on a simple query predicate. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, Hibernate Search 7.1 is a drop-in replacement for 7.0, assuming you also upgrade the dependencies. Information about deprecated configuration and API is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marco Belladelli', 'Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: 6.2.2.Final. What’s new This release includes several bug fixes and small performance improvements. Batch fetch performance The performance of batch fetch loading (@BatchSize) has been improved by better caching of SQL AST and other references where possible. See HHH-16441 for details. SQL ARRAY for multi-key loads When loading entities or collections by multiple keys, Hibernate can now utilize a SQL ARRAY valued parameter to pass all ids at once. This is implemented for all multi-key loads: Batch fecthing Session#byMultipleIds Session#byMultipleNaturalId This is limited to single-column keys and databases which support ARRAY types. In cases where an ARRAY parameter cannot be used, Hibernate falls back to its padded strategy which uses a pre-built SQL AST with a fix-sized IN parameter list. See HHH-16466 for details. Bugfixes Table resolution and self referencing associations We have fixed how Hibernate internally resolves the table references to use in a query, with special care put towards self referencing associations and possible optimizations using foreign key columns (see HHH-16382 and related issues). Bytecode Enhancement We have fixed a couple issues related to bytecode enhancement: Faulty code was generated when bidirectional association management was enabled, preventing Hibernate from correctly handling both sides of the association (see HHH-15602). When both a lazy @ManyToOne association and an eager one were used on the same entity, in some cases Hibernate would not eagerly initialize the latter (see HHH-16477). GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses We have fixed several bugs related to GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses: When grouping by an entity valued property (like a to-one association), we now always expand the rendered GROUP BY clause to use all columns of the entity type to guarantee that the underlying DBMS can correctly group the selections (see HHH-16409). When using window or ordered-set aggregate functions, we now explicitly disallow using aliased or positional expressions in the ORDER BY clause to prevent problematic query interpretation. We also fixed a bug that was preventing users from ordering by multiple column expression in OVER and WITHIN GROUP clauses (see HHH-16347). @Where clause We fixed a bug causing the @Where clause to be mis-rendered when used in a delete mutation query, specifically for the subquery to clean up association tables (see HHH-16392). Sybase and jConnect JDBC driver We have fixed several issues encountered when using Sybase with the jConnect JDBC driver, for a detailed view of the fixes please see the full list of changes link at the bottom of the page. Java Records Support for Java Records annotated with @Embeddable was introduced with Hibernate 6.2, but there were still a couple issues: Java Record embeddables were not included in the JPA metamodel generation (see HHH-16261). Java Record embeddables properties were not correctly ordered in ValueAccess#getValues() (see HHH-16457). Generics We continue to improve support for using Java Generics in entity classes, this time we solved an issue regarding a generic enum property annotated with @Enumerated (see HHH-16479). You can find the full list of changes in this version here. Conclusion For additional details, see: the User Guide the Migration Guide the release page. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We just published Hibernate Search 6.2.0.Beta1, a beta release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search. This version brings highlighting in the Search DSL, indexing plan filters to suspend automatic indexing, an Elasticsearch schema export tool, mapping annotations for constructor parameters when using @ProjectionConstructor, and .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() options in sorts. 6.2.0.Beta1 also includes many bugfixes and improvements, compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.8 and OpenSearch 2.7, an upgrade of -orm6 artifacts to Hibernate ORM 6.2.4.Final, and more. What’s new Hibernate Search 6.2 is still in development: some features are still incomplete or may change in a backward-incompatible way. Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-4860) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.2.4.Final for -orm6 artifacts. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-4857) The Elasticsearch backend now works with Elasticsearch 8.8 as well as other versions that were already compatible. OpenSearch (HSEARCH-4850) The Elasticsearch backend now works with OpenSearch 2.7 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-4857: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.8.0 Highlighting With HSEARCH-2192, Hibernate Search now offers a new feature in the Search DSL: highlighting. Highlighting is a projection that returns fragments from full-text fields of matched documents that caused a query match. Specific terms that caused the match are "highlighted" with a pair of opening and closing tags. It can help a user to quickly identify the information they were searching for on a results page. For example, one can enable highlighting on a full-text field like this: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @FullTextField(analyzer = "english") private String title; @FullTextField(analyzer = "english", highlightable = Highlightable.ANY) private String description; } And then retrieve highlights like this: SearchSession searchSession = /* ... */ List<List<String>> result = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.highlight( "description" ) ) .where( f -> f.match().field( "description" ).matching( "robot" ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Which can for example return the following highlights: # Hit #0 ["A <em>robot</em> becomes self-aware."] # Hit #1 ["A <em>robot</em> helps investigate a murder on an extrasolar colony.", "On this planet, <em>robots</em> are used extensively."] # etc. This is a simple example, but highligting can be configured extensively. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Indexing plan filters With HSEARCH-168/HSEARCH-1383, Hibernate Search now allow enabling/disabling indexing in indexing plans (which include in particular automatic indexing), both fully (for all types) or on a per-type basis. For example, the following will disable automatic indexing for future changes on all instances of the class Company, except for instances of its subclass Customer: SearchMapping searchMapping = /* ... */ searchMapping.indexingPlanFilter( ctx -> ctx.exclude( Company.class ) .include( Customer.class ) ); Indexing plan filters can also be configured per-session (though limitations apply when using the outbox-polling coordination strategy): SearchSession searchSession = /* ... */ searchSession.indexingPlanFilter( ctx -> ctx.exclude( Company.class ) .include( Customer.class ) ); See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Mapping annotations for constructor parameters when using @ProjectionConstructor HSEARCH-4574 adds mapping annotations for constructor parameters when using @ProjectionConstructor. This means in particular you can now project to other things than just fields when using @ProjectionConstructor, for example the entity identifier: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookIdAndTitleProjection( @IdProjection (1) Integer id, String title (2) ) { } 1 Projects to the entity identifier (explicit projection through an explicit annotation) 2 Projects to field title (implicit projection) But this also allows configuring field projections more precisely, for example setting the path of a field projection to something else than just the name of the constructor parameter: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookTitleAndAuthorNamesProjection( @FieldProjection (1) String title, @FieldProjection(path = "authors.lastName") (2) List<String> authorLastNames ) { } 1 Projects to field title (path derived from the name of the constructor parameter) 2 Projects to field authors.lastName (explicit path) See this section of the reference documentation for more information about this feature in general, and the documentation of each projection for more information about each available annotation. Search DSL improvements .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() options in sorts (HSEARCH-4149) When sorting on a field that may not have a value for some documents, it was already possible to use .missing().first()/.missing().last() to tell Hibernate Search to put such documents in first/last position (respectively), regardless of sorting order (ascending/descending). It is now possible, as an alternative, to use .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() to tell Hibernate Search to consider such documents as having the lowest/highest value (respectively), taking into account sorting order (ascending/descending): .missing().lowest() puts documents with no value in the first position when using ascending order or in the last position when using descending order. .missing().highest() puts documents with no value in the last position when using ascending order or in the first position when using descending order. This is mostly useful when the position of missing values is hardcoded, but the sort order is given by the user: SortOrder orderFromUser = /* ... */; List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .sort( f -> f.field( "pageCount" ).missing().lowest().order( orderFromuser ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Elasticsearch schema export It is now possible to export the Elasticsearch schema that Hibernate Search expects to JSON files on the filesystem: SearchSchemaManager schemaManager = searchSession.schemaManager(); schemaManager.exportExpectedSchema( Path.of( "mydirectory" ) ); The code above will result in a directory tree similar to this: # For the default backend: backend/indexes/<index-name>/<file> mydirectory/backend/indexes/customer/create-index.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/customer/create-index-query-params.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/order/create-index.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/order/create-index-query-params.json # For additional named backends: backend/<backend-name>/indexes/<index-name>/<file> mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/user/create-index.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/user/create-index-query-params.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/usergroup/create-index.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/usergroup/create-index-query-params.json See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4808: Added a new configuration option for the Elasticsearch client’s connection keep-alive: hibernate.search.backend.max_keep_alive. HSEARCH-4772: Reporting of non-fatal failures during mass indexing is now limited to a certain number of failures, which will prevent those failures from flooding the logs. The limit can be customized with MassIndexer#failureFloodingThreshold(long). HSEARCH-4843: The various module-specific EntityReference interfaces are now deprecated; use the common org.hibernate.search.engine.common.EntityReference instead. HSEARCH-4827: The object projection will no longer allow inner projections that are not affected by nesting (e.g. id, score, …). HSEARCH-4803: Hibernate Search will now properly ignore internal ServiceConfigurationErrors when appropriate. HSEARCH-4825: Hibernate Search-generated Elasticsearch dynamic templates will now be merged with those defined by custom mappings, instead of being erased as soon as a custom mapping are defined (even if those didn’t mention any dynamic templates). HSEARCH-4853: Hibernate Search will now properly handle canonical record constructors used as projection constructors on JDK 21-ea+21 and above. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, Hibernate Search 6.2 is a drop-in replacement for 6.1, assuming you also upgrade the dependencies.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We are pleased to announce the release of Hibernate Search 6.2.0.Final. This release brings in particular a new standalone POJO Mapper, mapping of classes/records to projections using @ProjectionConstructor, highlighting, Elasticsearch schema export, and more bugfixes and improvements. 6.2.0.Final also includes compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.8 and OpenSearch 2.8, as well as an upgrade of -orm6 artifacts to Hibernate ORM 6.2. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 6.1 Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM Hibernate Search still depends on Hibernate ORM 5.6 by default. -orm6 artifacts depend on Hibernate ORM 6.2. Lucene The Lucene backend still uses Lucene 8.11. Elasticsearch The Elasticsearch backend now works with Elasticsearch 8.8 and 7.17 as well as other versions that were already compatible. OpenSearch The Elasticsearch backend now works with OpenSearch 1.3 and 2.8 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Standalone POJO Mapper The Standalone POJO Mapper enables mapping arbitrary POJOs to indexes. Its key feature compared to the Hibernate ORM integration is its ability to run without Hibernate ORM or a relational database. It can be used to index entities coming from an arbitrary datastore or even (though that’s not recommended in general) to use Lucene or Elasticsearch as a primary datastore. For more information about the Standalone POJO Mapper, see this section of the reference documentation. To get started with the Standalone POJO Mapper, see this getting started guide. Mapping index content to custom types (projection constructors) Hibernate Search now offers the ability to define projections through the mapping of custom types (typically records), by applying the @ProjectionConstructor annotation to those types or their constructor: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookProjection(String title, List<Author> authors) { @ProjectionConstructor public record Author(String firstName, String lastName) { } } Executing such a projection then becomes as easy as referencing the custom type: List<MyBookProjection> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( MyBookProjection.class ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); More advanced projections can be configured through explicit annotations, for example a projection to the entity identifier: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookIdAndTitleProjection( @IdProjection (1) Integer id, String title (2) ) { } 1 Projects to the entity identifier (explicit projection through an explicit annotation) 2 Projects to field title (implicit projection) Explicit annotations also allow configuring field projections more precisely, for example setting the path of a field projection to something else than just the name of the constructor parameter: @ProjectionConstructor public record MyBookTitleAndAuthorNamesProjection( @FieldProjection (1) String title, @FieldProjection(path = "authors.lastName") (2) List<String> authorLastNames ) { } 1 Projects to field title (path derived from the name of the constructor parameter) 2 Projects to field authors.lastName (explicit path) See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Highlighting Hibernate Search now offers a new feature in the Search DSL: highlighting. Highlighting is a projection that returns fragments from full-text fields of matched documents that caused a query match. Specific terms that caused the match are "highlighted" with a pair of opening and closing tags. It can help a user to quickly identify the information they were searching for on a results page. For example, one can enable highlighting on a full-text field like this: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @FullTextField(analyzer = "english") private String title; @FullTextField(analyzer = "english", projectable = Projectable.YES) private String description; } And then retrieve highlights like this: SearchSession searchSession = /* ... */ List<List<String>> result = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.highlight( "description" ) ) .where( f -> f.match().field( "description" ).matching( "robot" ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Which can for example return the following highlights: # Hit #0 ["A <em>robot</em> becomes self-aware."] # Hit #1 ["A <em>robot</em> helps investigate a murder on an extrasolar colony.", "On this planet, <em>robots</em> are used extensively."] # etc. This is a simple example, but highligting can be configured extensively. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Indexing plan filters Hibernate Search now allows enabling/disabling indexing in indexing plans (which includes in particular listener-triggered indexing), both fully (for all types) or on a per-type basis. For example, the following will disable automatic indexing for future changes on all instances of the class Company, except for instances of its subclass Customer: SearchMapping searchMapping = /* ... */ searchMapping.indexingPlanFilter( ctx -> ctx.exclude( Company.class ) .include( Customer.class ) ); Indexing plan filters can also be configured per-session (though limitations apply when using the outbox-polling coordination strategy): SearchSession searchSession = /* ... */ searchSession.indexingPlanFilter( ctx -> ctx.exclude( Company.class ) .include( Customer.class ) ); See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Mapping improvements @IndexedEmbedded(excludePaths = …) The @IndexedEmbedded annotation now exposes an excludePaths attribute, allowing the inclusion of all paths with only a few selectively excluded, as opposed to the pre-existing approach of selectively including paths with includePaths. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Projectable fields All fields are now projectable by default with the Elasticsearch backend. This change was made because making a field projectable doesn’t incur any performance penalty with the Elasticsearch backend. Since making a field projectable does have an impact on performance with the Lucene backend, the defaults with the Lucene backend didn’t change: Lucene fields still need to be made projectable explicitly. Search DSL improvements Simpler boolean operators with the and/or/not predicates For simpler use cases, you can now avoid the rather complex bool predicate and use the new and/or/not predicates instead: List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.and( f.match().field( "title" ) .matching( "robot" ), f.match().field( "description" ) .matching( "crime" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.or( f.match().field( "title" ) .matching( "robot" ), f.match().field( "description" ) .matching( "investigation" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.not( f.match() .field( "genre" ) .matching( Genre.SCIENCE_FICTION ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Shorter syntax for complex, root boolean predicates Instead of .where( f → f.bool( b → … ) ), you can now use .where( (f, b) → … ): MySearchParameters searchParameters = getSearchParameters(); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( (f, root) -> { root.add( f.matchAll() ); if ( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.match().field( "genre" ) .matching( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() ) ); } if ( searchParameters.getFullTextFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.match().fields( "title", "description" ) .matching( searchParameters.getFullTextFilter() ) ); } if ( searchParameters.getPageCountMaxFilter() != null ) { root.add( f.range().field( "pageCount" ) .atMost( searchParameters.getPageCountMaxFilter() ) ); } } ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The older syntax has been deprecated in favor of the new one. Clearer syntax for complex, non-root boolean predicates Instead of f.bool( b → … ), you can now use f.bool().with( b → … ): MySearchParameters searchParameters = getSearchParameters(); List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( (f, b) -> { b.must( f.matchAll() ); if ( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() != null ) { b.must( f.match().field( "genre" ) .matching( searchParameters.getGenreFilter() ) ); } if ( !searchParameters.getAuthorFilters().isEmpty() ) { b.must( f.bool().with( b2 -> { for ( String authorFilter : searchParameters.getAuthorFilters() ) { b2.should( f.match().fields( "authors.firstName", "authors.lastName" ) .matching( authorFilter ) ); } } ) ); } } ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The older syntax has been deprecated in favor of the new one. Clearer syntax for the nested predicate Instead of f.nested().objectField( … ).nest( f.bool().must( … ) ), you can now use f.nested( … ).add( … ): List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.nested( "authors" ) .add( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ) .matching( "isaac" ) ) .add( f.match().field( "authors.lastName" ) .matching( "asimov" ) ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The older syntax has been deprecated in favor of the new one. New matchNone predicate The matchNone predicate matches no documents. List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.matchNone() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); New syntax for composite projections The definition of composite projections is now possible with a fluent syntax: List<MyPair<String, Genre>> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.composite() .from( f.field( "title", String.class ), f.field( "genre", Genre.class ) ) .as( MyPair::new ) ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Most older syntaxes have been deprecated in favor of the new one. New object projection The object projection yields one projected value for each object in a given object field. List<List<MyAuthorName>> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.object( "authors" ) .from( f.field( "authors.firstName", String.class ), f.field( "authors.lastName", String.class ) ) .as( MyAuthorName::new ) .multi() ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); New constant projection The constant projection returns the same value for every single document, the value being provided when defining the projection. Instant searchRequestTimestamp = Instant.now(); List<MyPair<Integer, Instant>> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .select( f -> f.composite() .from( f.id( Integer.class ), f.constant( searchRequestTimestamp ) ) .as( MyPair::new ) ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .fetchHits( 20 ); .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() options in sorts When sorting on a field that may not have a value for some documents, it was already possible to use .missing().first()/.missing().last() to tell Hibernate Search to put such documents in first/last position (respectively), regardless of sorting order (ascending/descending). It is now possible, as an alternative, to use .missing().lowest()/.missing().highest() to tell Hibernate Search to consider such documents as having the lowest/highest value (respectively), taking into account sorting order (ascending/descending): .missing().lowest() puts documents with no value in the first position when using ascending order or in the last position when using descending order. .missing().highest() puts documents with no value in the last position when using ascending order or in the first position when using descending order. This is mostly useful when the position of missing values is hardcoded, but the sort order is given by the user: SortOrder orderFromUser = /* ... */; List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.matchAll() ) .sort( f -> f.field( "pageCount" ).missing().lowest().order( orderFromuser ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); Mass indexing improvements Mass indexing multiple tenants In multi-tenant applications, mass indexing can now handle multiple tenants at once, provided you don’t pass any tenant identifier when creating the mass indexer, and you provided a list of tenants in the Hibernate Search configuration. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Setting up thread locals during mass indexing The mass indexer now has a concept of "mass indexing environment", allowing for instance to set up custom thread locals in mass indexing threads. See the environment parameter in this section of the reference documentation for more information. Better exception handling Exceptions thrown by Hibernate ORM during mass indexing are now passed to the failure handler as every other exception, instead of aborting the whole mass indexing. Smarter defaults for parameters purgeAllOnStart is now disabled by default in the mass indexer when dropAndCreateSchemaOnStart is enabled. outbox-polling coordination improvements Outbox events and agents now use UUIDs for their identifiers The primary key of the relevant tables are now using UUIDs instead of longs, to avoid reliance on sequences that were slowing down event processing on some databases. The migration guide includes migration scripts for the necessary database schema changes. Customizable database schema Simple, straightforward configuration properties now allow customizing the database schema involved in Hibernate Search’s outbox-polling coordination strategy: table names, schema and catalog, type of UUID columns as well as UUID generation strategy (random vs. time). See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Elasticsearch schema export It is now possible to export the Elasticsearch schema that Hibernate Search expects to JSON files on the filesystem: SearchSchemaManager schemaManager = searchSession.schemaManager(); schemaManager.exportExpectedSchema( Path.of( "mydirectory" ) ); The code above will result in a directory tree similar to this: # For the default backend: backend/indexes/<index-name>/<file> mydirectory/backend/indexes/customer/create-index.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/customer/create-index-query-params.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/order/create-index.json mydirectory/backend/indexes/order/create-index-query-params.json # For additional named backends: backend/<backend-name>/indexes/<index-name>/<file> mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/user/create-index.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/user/create-index-query-params.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/usergroup/create-index.json mydirectory/backends/auth/indexes/usergroup/create-index-query-params.json See this section of the reference documentation for more information.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Steve Ebersole', 'We are considering a change of license for Hibernate projects to Apache License 2.0. In fact, more recent Hibernate projects have started out using that license. While we still believe that our long published interpretation of LGPL to be compatible with ASL and similar licenses, enough FUD has been spread about it to be considered a lost cause in terms of inclusion in various projects. At this point, it just makes sense to change - it opens up wider acceptance amongst Apache/Jakarta projects and others. In the coming weeks we will be sending emails to developers who have made significant, still-relevant contributions to the codebase over the years. We want to respect the wishes of all of us.

Soft Delete 6.4 adds support for soft deletes using the new @SoftDelete annotation. @Entity @SoftDelete class Account { ... } Dealing with values as deleted/non-deleted versus active/inactive (reversed) is simple using an annotation attribute: @Entity @SoftDelete(strategy=ACTIVE) class Account { ... } It even supports pluggable converters for dealing with what gets stored in the database. See the User Guide for details. HQL Vector Support 6.4 introduces a new module hibernate-vector that offers support for mathematical vector types and functions that are useful for the AI/ML space to do vector similarity search. The current implementation only supports running with PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension enabled and maps various functions to the underlying pgvector operators that enable efficient index access. See the Query Guide for details. HQL/Criteria Array Functions Following up on earlier work, 6.4 adds the remaining functions for handling arrays in HQL and Criteria queries. See the Query Guide for excellent coverage of these functions. These functions are still incubating and some things (names, etc.) may change before Final. Java Flight Recorder Events 6.4 adds support for producing Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events. This works natively on many JDKs, but we recently discovered that not all of them implement the JFR spec, despite it being part of Open JDK. For this reason we have created a separate module that will ensure compatibility, and applications will need to include the new hibernate-jfr artifact on the classpath in order to use Java Flight Recorder events integration. See the User Guide for details. Non-String Tenant Id 6.4 adds support for using tenant-id with types other than String. See HHH-14822 for details.

What’s new This release includes several bug fixes and small performance improvements. Hibernate Spatial PostGIS distance operators We have added HQL support for the native PostGIS distance operators. For details, see HHH-15160. Bugfixes Refresh operations We have fixed a couple of issues related to the refresh operation: An error was triggered when calling refresh on an entity with both lazy and eager associations (see HHH-16423). The lazy loading of associated collections failed after calling refresh on an entity (see HHH-16447). Associated collection loading We have fixed several bugs related to loading an entity’s associated collections: Loading an Entity with two eager collections produced duplicates if one of the collection is a bag (see HHH-16453). Multiple identical SELECT statements were issues to load an optional one-to-one association (see HHH-16469). Treated paths and entity types We have improved Hibernate’s handling of treated entity types. Previously, in some cases, we were creating too restrictive queries for certain inheritance structures and treated paths. With this new logic we should always guarantee correct results while also gaining improved query optimization and performance (see HHH-15726). Generics We continue to improve support for Java Generics: we added handling for generic component properties (i.e. @Embedded and @EmbeddedId) that will allow the use of Generics while being consistent with the JPA specification and providing correct results (see HHH-16491). There are more improvements and bugfixes included in this version. You can find the full list of changes here.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We just published a new candidate release for Hibernate Search: 7.0.0.CR1. This release brings in particular compatibility with Hibernate ORM’s discriminator-based multi-tenancy, compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.10 and OpenSearch 2.10/2.11, an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 6.3.1.Final, an upgrade to Lucene 9.8, some Maven artifact renamings, and other bugfixes and improvements. What’s new For a summary of all new features and improvements since 6.2, head to the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Dependency upgrades JDK 11 (reminder) Hibernate Search now requires Java 11 as a baseline and is no longer compatible with Java 8. Switch to Jakarta EE (reminder) Hibernate Search completely switched to Jakarta EE and is not compatible with Java EE anymore. All of -orm6 and -jakarta artifacts from the previous series that provided Hibernate ORM 6 and Jakarta EE compatibility are now unavailable since this compatibility is now provided by the main artifacts. Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-4959) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.3.1.Final. Lucene (HSEARCH-4982) The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.8. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-4946) The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.10 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for the following versions whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life: 5.x/6.x (compatibility already dropped in Hibernate Search 7.0.0.Beta1) 7.0-7.9 (newly dropped in HSEARCH-4934) OpenSearch (HSEARCH-4978/HSEARCH-4993) The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.10 and 2.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 whose compatibility was dropped in HSEARCH-4934, because they already reached their end of life. Others HSEARCH-4941/HSEARCH-4946/HSEARCH-4958/HSEARCH-4967/HSEARCH-4990/HSEARCH-4994: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.10.4 HSEARCH-4957 Upgrade to Jackson 2.15.2 HSEARCH-4984 Upgrade to Avro 1.11.3 HSEARCH-4992 Upgrade to AWS SDK 2.21.1 Compatibility with Hibernate ORM’s discriminator-based multi-tenancy With HSEARCH-4403, Hibernate Search can now index Hibernate ORM entities that take advantage of discriminator-based multi-tenancy in the database (@TenandId). Maven artifact renamings Some Hibernate Search Maven artifacts have been renamed: HSEARCH-4940 Maven artifacts related to JSR-352 artifacts were renamed to reflect the move to the Jakarta EE specification: hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-core. hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-jberet was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-jberet. HSEARCH-4928 The artifact hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-outbox-polling. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4938: The complement operator (~) in regexp predicates is no longer supported. HSEARCH-4947: Hibernate Search will no longer fail to boot on Windows in some setups. Thanks to Gábor Lipták for reporting this and helping test the fix! HSEARCH-4487: The Jakarta Batch Mass Indexing job has been redesigned to mirror more closely the behavior of the MassIndexer. As a result, it will no longer fail when indexing entities containing a @IndexedEmbedded and using MySQL with an idFetchSize set to Integer.MIN_VALUE. Thanks to Ivan Kotev for reporting this and helping identify the cause! HSEARCH-4980: Hibernate Search will no longer fail when trying to index entities with composite identifiers in the Jakarta Batch Mass Indexing job. HSEARCH-4969: Fixed a bug caused by a mistake in the Lucene 9 upgrade, where TextMultiValues would trigger an IndexOutOfBoundsException. HSEARCH-4983: Fixed a potential concurrency issue in the Lucene backend that could lead to "`LockObtainFailedException`: Lock held by this virtual machine". HSEARCH-4986: The Jakarta Batch Mass Indexing job will no longer fail in the partition mapping stage for some JDBC drivers (DB2, MSSQL, …). HSEARCH-4988: Hibernate Search will no longer fail on startup with a StackOverflowError when mapping types that are containers of their own type, such as java.nio.Path which implements Iterable<Path>. Attempting to use default container extraction on such types will fail with a clear explanation, and disabling container extraction or otherwise resolving the infinite recursion will work as expected. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, assuming you were already using Hibernate Search 6.2 with -orm6 artifacts, upgrading to Hibernate Search 7.0 mainly requires removing the -orm6 suffix from your Hibernate Search dependencies updating the version numbers (alternatively you can use the BOM), and of course aligning your other dependencies (e.g. Hibernate ORM), if any. Information about migration, deprecations and breaking changes is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We are pleased to announce the release of Hibernate Search 7.0.0.Final. Compared to Hibernate Search 6.2, this release upgrades its baseline to JDK 11 and Hibernate ORM 6.4, brings compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.10/8.11 and OpenSearch 2.10/2.11, and upgrades to Lucene 9.8. Hibernate Search 7.0 also brings new features such as a brand-new Hibernate Search BOM, experimental compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, compatibility with Hibernate ORM’s discriminator-based multi-tenancy, and other bugfixes and improvements. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 6.2 Java Hibernate Search is now using JDK 11 as a baseline and can work on JDK 11, 17 or 21. Compatibility with JDK 8 was dropped. Hibernate ORM Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4 as it fully switched to Jakarta EE. There are no -orm6/-jakarta artifacts or Java EE compatibility anymore. Lucene The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.8. Upgrading requires reindexing, see the migration guide for details. Elasticsearch The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.10/8.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for the following versions whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life: 5.x/6.x 7.0-7.9 OpenSearch The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.10 and 2.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life. Hibernate Search BOM Hibernate Search now offers a BOM providing dependency management for all of its published artifacts. It can be imported as part of your dependency management to keep the versions of Hibernate Search artifacts aligned: <dependencyManagement> <dependencies> <!-- Import Hibernate Search BOM to get all of its artifact versions aligned: --> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-bom</artifactId> <version>7.0.0.Final</version> <type>pom</type> <scope>import</scope> </dependency> <!-- Any other dependency management entries --> </dependencies> </dependencyManagement> <!-- ... --> <dependencies> <!-- Declare dependencies --> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-mapper-orm</artifactId> <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above --> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId> <artifactId>hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch</artifactId> <!-- The version is managed by the BOM above --> </dependency> <!-- Any other dependency entries --> </dependencies> Amazon OpenSearch Serverless experimental compatibility Hibernate Search now has incubating compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. Amazon OpenSearch Serverless has certain limitations compared to a regular OpenSearch cluster and may not support all operations a regular cluster does. Compatibility with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless must be enabled explicitly by setting the backend version property: hibernate.search.backend.version=amazon-opensearch-serverless See this section of the reference documentation for more information, in particular about limitations. Compatibility with Hibernate ORM’s discriminator-based multi-tenancy Hibernate Search can now index Hibernate ORM entities that take advantage of discriminator-based multi-tenancy in the database (@TenandId). Maven artifact renamings Some Hibernate Search Maven artifacts have been renamed: Maven artifacts related to JSR-352 artifacts were renamed to reflect the move to the Jakarta EE specification: hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-core. hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-jberet was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta-batch-jberet. The artifact hibernate-search-mapper-orm-coordination-outbox-polling was renamed to hibernate-search-mapper-orm-outbox-polling. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 7.0.0.CR2 For a list of changes since 7.0.0.CR2 only, refer to the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, assuming you were already using Hibernate Search 6.2 with -orm6 artifacts, upgrading to Hibernate Search 7.0 mainly requires removing the -orm6 suffix from your Hibernate Search dependencies updating the version numbers (alternatively you can use the BOM), and of course aligning your other dependencies (e.g. Hibernate ORM), if any. Information about migration, deprecations and breaking changes is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Christian Beikov', 'Hibernate ORM version 6.2.0.Final is around the corner, and the following post tries to shed some light on one of the new features that comes with that release. Supported database versions For a long time, Hibernate kept around code for supporting database versions that are now considered ancient. It wasn’t always clear what the minimum database version is that is supposed to be supported and there was no continuous testing against old or the latest version of a database. The Hibernate team tried to support database versions on a best effort basis. With Hibernate 6.0 the team wanted to do better and by making sure we commit ourselves to a certain set of DBs, and move dialects for other DBs into a new module, called hibernate-community-dialects. We provided clear requirements for vendors on how to get their dialects to hibernate-core. Another thing that changed with Hibernate 6.0 is that dialects can now self-configure based on the database version, which eliminated the need for the various version specific dialects. There was still some overhead for dialect maintenance due to code that was trying to emulate certain functions or SQL constructs for ancient database versions. Since the Hibernate team is relatively small when considering the size of the project, we decided to clarify the supported set of databases in version 6.2 by also specifying versions which are supported. Doing so will make it easily understandable for users what Hibernate supports and what not. Additionally, it allows us to get rid of some code which makes maintenance easier. As of version 6.2, every dialect will have a "minimum supported version" attached, and during self-configuration of the dialect, it will check if the database version is greater or equal to that. If it isn’t, Hibernate emits a warning. Dialects that support even older database versions were moved to the hibernate-community-dialects module and are only updated on a best effort basis. In general, Hibernate ties its database version support to the support cycle of the respective vendor. Minor versions of Hibernate might drop support for database versions that have become unsupported. The list of version support changes for Hibernate 6.2 can be nicely seen on HHH-15175 Outlook Hibernate 6.3 will be the next minor version and as part of that, support for some more database versions will be dropped. The list of planned version support changes can be seen on HHH-15491. I hope that this insight into the process of database version support is not a shocker to anyone.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We just published Hibernate Search 6.2.0.CR1, a candidate release of the next minor version of Hibernate Search. This release brings in particular a new excludePaths filter for @IndexedEmbedded, and includePaths/includeDepth/excludePaths filters for @ObjectProjection. 6.2.0.CR1 also includes compatibility with OpenSearch 2.8, an upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.6.15.Final, an upgrade of -orm6 artifacts to Hibernate ORM 6.2.5.Final, and other bugfixes and improvements. What’s new For a summary of all new features and improvements since 6.1, head to the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Dependency upgrades Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-4880/HSEARCH-4875/HSEARCH-4869) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 5.6.15.Final for its main artifacts, and 6.2.5.Final for -orm6 artifacts. Hibernate ORM 6.0 and 6.1 are no longer considered compatible. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-4857) The Elasticsearch backend now works with Elasticsearch 8.8 as well as other versions that were already compatible. OpenSearch (HSEARCH-4870) The Elasticsearch backend now works with OpenSearch 2.8 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Others HSEARCH-4871: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.8.1 @IndexedEmbedded(excludePaths = …) With HSEARCH-1182, the @IndexedEmbedded annotation now exposes an excludePaths attribute, allowing the inclusion of all paths with only a few selectively excluded, as opposed to the previous approach of selectively including paths with includePaths. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. @ObjectProjection(includeDepth = …)/@ObjectProjection(includePaths = …)/@ObjectProjection(excludePaths = …) With HSEARCH-4725, the @ObjectProjection annotation now exposes an includeDepth/includePaths/excludePaths attributes, which allows in particular breaking cycles of nested object projections. See this section of the reference documentation for more information. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4616: For clarity, "automatic indexing" was renamed to something more explicit throughout Hibernate Search and its documentation. As a result: hibernate.search.automatic_indexing.enabled is now deprecated in favor of hibernate.search.indexing.listeners.enabled hibernate.search.automatic_indexing.synchronization.strategy is now deprecated in favor of hibernate.search.indexing.plan.synchronization.strategy HSEARCH-4866: hibernate.search.automatic_indexing.enable_dirty_check is now deprecated with no alternative to replace it. In future versions, a dirty check will always be performed when considering whether to trigger reindexing. HSEARCH-4877: (Infinispan) Provided identifier bridges are now applied in the Search DSL and id projections. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, Hibernate Search 6.2 is a drop-in replacement for 6.1, assuming you also upgrade the dependencies. Information about deprecated configuration and API is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Yoann Rodière', 'We just published a new candidate release for Hibernate Search: 7.0.0.CR2. This release upgrades to the recently released Hibernate ORM 6.4; as this upgrade implies dropping compatibility with Hibernate ORM 6.3, it was deemed a big enough change to warrant a second candidate release. 7.0.0.CR2 also contains a few bugfixes and improvements; see below for more information. What’s new For a summary of all new features and improvements since 6.2, head to the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Dependency upgrades JDK 11 (reminder) Hibernate Search now requires Java 11 as a baseline and is no longer compatible with Java 8. Switch to Jakarta EE (reminder) Hibernate Search completely switched to Jakarta EE and is not compatible with Java EE anymore. All of -orm6 and -jakarta artifacts from the previous series that provided Hibernate ORM 6 and Jakarta EE compatibility are now unavailable since this compatibility is now provided by the main artifacts. Hibernate ORM (HSEARCH-5008) Hibernate Search now depends on Hibernate ORM 6.4.0.Final. Lucene (reminder) The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.8. Elasticsearch (HSEARCH-5005/HSEARCH-5012) The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for the following versions whose compatibility was dropped, because they already reached their end of life: 5.x/6.x (compatibility dropped in Hibernate Search 7.0.0.Beta1) 7.0-7.9 (compatibility dropped in Hibernate Search 7.0.0.CR1) OpenSearch (reminder) The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.10 and 2.11 as well as other versions that were already compatible — except for versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 whose compatibility was dropped in Hibernate Search 7.0.0.CR1, because they already reached their end of life. Others HSEARCH-5005/HSEARCH-5012: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.11.1 HSEARCH-4996 Upgrade to JBeret 2.1.3.Final Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-4995: Hibernate Search will no longer log exceptions encountered during complex operations (boot, schema validation) at the ERROR level, but at the TRACE level. To propagate these exceptions, Hibernate Search will add them as "suppressed" to the exception thrown at the end (of boot/schema validation). This means in particular that explicit uses of SchemaManager (e.g. for schema validation) that encounter exceptions (e.g. inconsistent Elasticsearch index aliases) will no longer flood the logs, but will instead result in an exception with all the necessary information, in its own message (failure report with short description of all failures) and in its suppressed exception (full stack trace of all relevant exceptions). HSEARCH-4999: Elasticsearch spatial predicates will now use the geo_shape query instead of the deprecated geo_polygon query. HSEARCH-5015: OutboxEvent is no longer a final class, avoiding warnings in some situations where Hibernate ORM would try to generate proxy classes for OutboxEvent. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, assuming you were already using Hibernate Search 6.2 with -orm6 artifacts, upgrading to Hibernate Search 7.0 mainly requires removing the -orm6 suffix from your Hibernate Search dependencies updating the version numbers (alternatively you can use the BOM), and of course aligning your other dependencies (e.g. Hibernate ORM), if any. Information about migration, deprecations and breaking changes is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Christian Beikov', 'Hibernate ORM version 6.2.0.Final is around the corner, and the following post tries to shed some light on one of the new features that comes with that release. With clause The with clause was introduced in SQL:1999 and allows to specify common table expressions (CTEs), which can be imagined like named subqueries. Every uncorrelated subquery can be factored to a CTE in the with clause. The semantics are equivalent. The with clause offers features beyond naming subqueries though: Specify materialization hints Recursive querying The most important part of CTEs is the support for recursive querying that allows to query hierarchies or graphs of data. Hibernate chose to support the same syntax as the SQL standard, though there are some differences: No need for the recursive keyword - Hibernate infers that information Specifying cte attribute names has to be done through select item aliases. Names in the CTE header are not allowed queryExpression : withClause? orderedQuery (setOperator orderedQuery)* ; withClause : "WITH" cte ("," cte)* ; cte : identifier AS ("NOT"? "MATERIALIZED")? "(" queryExpression ")" searchClause? cycleClause? ; Materialization hint The materialization hint MATERIALIZED or NOT MATERIALIZED can be applied to tell the DBMS whether a CTE should or shouldn’t be materialized. Consult the database manual of the respective database for the exact meaning of the hint. Usually, one can expect that MATERIALIZED will cause the subquery to be executed separately and saved into a temporary table, whereas NOT MATERIALIZED will cause the subquery to be inlined into every use site and considered during optimizations separately. with data as materialized( select p.person as owner, c.payment is not null as payed from Call c join c.phone p where p.number = :phoneNumber ) select d.owner, d.payed from data d Recursive querying The main use case for the with clause is to define a name for a subquery, such that this subquery can refer to itself, which ultimately enables recursive querying. Recursive CTEs must follow a very particular shape, which is Base query part union or union all Recursive query part with paymentConnectedPersons as( -- Base query part select a.owner owner from Account a where a.id = :startId -- union or union all union all -- Recursive query part select a2.owner owner from paymentConnectedPersons d join Account a on a.owner = d.owner join a.payments p join Account a2 on a2.owner = p.person ) select d.owner from paymentConnectedPersons d The base query part represents the initial set of rows. When fetching a tree of data, the base query part usually is the tree root. The recursive query part is executed again and again until it produces no new rows. The result of such a CTE is the base query part result unioned together with all recursive query part executions. Depending on whether union all or union (distinct) is used, duplicate rows are preserved or not. Recursive queries additionally can have a search clause to hint the DBMS whether to use breadth or depth first searching a cycle clause to hint the DBMS how to determine that a cycle was reached Defining the search clause requires specifying a name for an attribute in the set sub-clause, that will be added to the CTE type and allows ordering results according to the search order. searchClause : "SEARCH" ("BREADTH"|"DEPTH") "FIRST BY" searchSpecifications "SET" identifier ; searchSpecifications : searchSpecification ("," searchSpecification)* ; searchSpecification : identifier sortDirection? nullsPrecedence? ; A DBMS has two possible orders when executing the recursive query part Depth first - handle the newest produced rows by the recursive query part first Breadth first - handle the oldest produced rows by the recursive query part first with paymentConnectedPersons as( select a.owner owner from Account a where a.id = :startId union all select a2.owner owner from paymentConnectedPersons d join Account a on a.owner = d.owner join a.payments p join Account a2 on a2.owner = p.person ) search breadth first by owner set orderAttr select d.owner from paymentConnectedPersons d Recursive processing can lead to cycles which might lead to queries executing forever. The cycle clause hints the DBMS which CTE attributes to track for the cycle detection. It requires specifying a name for a cycle mark attribute in the set sub-clause, that will be added to the CTE type and allows detecting if a cycle occurred for a result. By default, the cycle mark attribute will be set to true when a cycle is detected and false otherwise. The values to use can be explicitly specified through the to and default sub-clauses. Optionally, it’s also possible to specify a cycle path attribute name through the using clause The cycle path attribute can be used to understand the traversal path that lead to a result. cycleClause : "CYCLE" cteAttributes "SET" identifier ("TO" literal "DEFAULT" literal)? ("USING" identifier)? ; with paymentConnectedPersons as( select a.owner owner from Account a where a.id = :startId union all select a2.owner owner from paymentConnectedPersons d join Account a on a.owner = d.owner join a.payments p join Account a2 on a2.owner = p.person ) cycle owner set cycleMark select d.owner, d.cycleMark from paymentConnectedPersons d Hibernate merely translates recursive CTEs but doesn’t attempt to emulate the feature. Therefore, this feature will only work if the database supports recursive CTEs. Hibernate does emulate the search and cycle clauses though if necessary, so you can safely use that. Note that most modern database versions support recursive CTEs already. Outlook This was a long awaited feature as you can tell from the issue number HHH-4030, so it’s great that Hibernate finally supports the with clause. You might think that we are already done with this, but there is still a nice little addition to recursive querying that can be made. We are currently discussing support for a recursive join fetch feature which would make fetching data trees a lot simpler.

In many ways, this release marks the final step for the major forcus of 6.x centered around changing how Hibernate generates SQL. Many improvements in this release, as well as 6.0 and 6.1, have been implemented on top of this SQL AST work. As of 6.0 and 6.1, Hibernate used this SQL AST for loading state from the database. With 6.2, Hibernate also uses SQL AST for writing to the database. Support for Structured SQL Types Hibernate now supports structured SQL types including struct, XML and JSON. Christian wrote a blog post about this support which covers the details. See also the Aggregate embeddable mapping and @Struct aggregate embeddable mapping User Guide sections. Support for Java records Hibernate now support the mapping of Java records as embeddables. E.g. @Embeddable public record Name( String firstName; String lastName; ) {} even combined with Support for Structured SQL Types to persist to a struct! @Embeddable @Struct(name = "Name") public record Name( String firstName; String lastName; ) {} See the @Struct aggregate embeddable mapping User Guide section for more details. Unified generated value support Support for generated persisted values has been has been unified to use the same contracts, whether for identifiers or other basic values, based on org.hibernate.annotations.Generated, org.hibernate.annotations.ValueGenerationType and org.hibernate.generator.Generator. E.g. @Generated( GenerationTime.INSERT ) @ColumnDefault( "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" ) private Date createdDate; or @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target( { ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE } ) @ValueGenerationType( generatedBy = UuidValueGeneration.class ) public @interface GeneratedUuidValue { GenerationTiming timing(); } public static class UuidValueGeneration implements BeforeExecutionGenerator {...} ... @GeneratedUuidValue( timing = GenerationTiming.INSERT ) public UUID createdUuid; See the Generated properties User Guide section for details. Database Partitions Hibernate now supports database partitions as a first-class citizen using org.hibernate.annotations.PartitionKey to map the parition column. E.g. @Entity public static class User { @Id private Integer id; ... @PartitionKey private String region; } See the Paritioning User Guide section for details. SQL MERGE for "optional table" updates Building on top of the SQL AST, Hibernate can now use the SQL MERGE command to handle updates against optional tables. An update to an optional table will have one of 3 ultimate outcomes: if there is no corresponding row already in the table, insert the row else if all the new "value" columns are null, delete the row else update the row The legacy behavior was to just do these if-checks ourselves at runtime and execute the insert, update and delete statements individually. The MERGE command allows that to happen more efficiently in a single JDBC call. Currently this is supported on: H2 Oracle SQL Server PostgreSQL The fall back is to just use the legacy behavior. Proprietary SQL types Dealing with certain SQL types requires access to JDBC driver specific classes in order to properly read and write values of that type. In some environments (various containers, e.g.), those classes are not available to Hibernate. Hibernate better handles these situations now when it can, usually based on casts to more standardized types. For example, we might read a JSON value from a ResultSet as a String by wrapping the JSON expression in a cast function.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marko Bekhta', 'We just published Hibernate Search 7.1.0.Alpha1, a first alpha release of the next major version of Hibernate Search. This version opens up possibilities for searching over binary (image, audio or video) data using vector search. Beyond that, it improves Hibernate Search compatibility with other frameworks. What’s new Hibernate Search 7.1 is still in its early stages of development: some features are still incomplete or may change in a backward-incompatible way. Vector search for the Lucene Backend Hibernate Search now allows vector search in the Lucene backend as an incubating feature. Vector search provides the tools to search over binary (images, audio or video) or text data: external tools convert that data to vectors (arrays of bytes or floats, also called "embeddings"), which are then used for indexing and queries in Hibernate Search. Hibernate Search introduces a new field type — @VectorField and a new predicate knn, so that the vectors can be indexed and then searched upon. Vector fields can work with vector data represented as byte or float arrays in the documents. Out of the box byte[] and float[] property types will work with the new field type. For any other entity property types, a custom value bridge or value binder should be implemented. Keep in mind that indexed vectors must be of the same length and that this length should be specified upfront for the schema to be created: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @VectorField(dimension = 512) private float[] coverImageEmbeddings; // Other properties ... } Searching for vector similarities is performed via a knn predicate: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // provide the number of similar documents to look for: f.knn( 5 ) // the name of the vector field: .field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ) // matched documents will be the ones whose indexed vector // is "most similar" to this vector .matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) // additionally an optional filter can be supplied // to provide a regular fulltext search predicate .filter( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ).matching( "arthur" ) ) ).fetchHits( 20 ); See this section of the reference documentation on vector fields and the one on a new knn predicate for more information. Other improvements and bug fixes HSEARCH-5024: Hibernate Search will no longer fail to boot when reading nested JARs in Spring Boot 3.2+. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, Hibernate Search 7.1 is a drop-in replacement for 7.0, assuming you also upgrade the dependencies. Information about deprecated configuration and API is included in the migration guide. Feedback, issues, ideas?

This release is compatible with Hibernate ORM 6.4.1.Final and Vert.x SQL driver 4.5.1. This version also contains: Support for the Order class introduced in Hibernate ORM 6.3 Support for Stateless#upsert on all databases Fix out of the box support for arrays of basic types The full list of changes is available on GitHub. We have also released Hibernate Reactive 2.0.8.Final.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marko Bekhta', 'We are pleased to announce the release of Hibernate Search 7.1.0.Final. Compared to Hibernate Search 7.0, this release introduces vector search capabilities, allows looking up the capabilities of each field in the metamodel, adds a new query string predicate, simplifies the entity registration in the Standalone POJO mapper, brings compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.12 and OpenSearch 2.12, upgrades to Lucene 9.9, and brings other bugfixes and improvements. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 7.0 Dependency upgrades Lucene The Lucene backend now uses Lucene 9.9. Besides other improvements it brings better vector search performance. Elasticsearch The Elasticsearch backend works with Elasticsearch 8.12 as well as other versions that were already compatible. OpenSearch The Elasticsearch backend works with OpenSearch 2.12 as well as other versions that were already compatible. Vector search for Lucene and Elasticsearch Backends Hibernate Search now allows vector search in Lucene and Elasticsearch backends as an incubating feature. Vector search provides the tools to search over binary (images, audio or video) or text data: external tools convert that data to vectors (arrays of bytes or floats, also called "embeddings"), which are then used for indexing and queries in Hibernate Search. Hibernate Search introduces a new field type — @VectorField and a new predicate knn, so that the vectors can be indexed and then searched upon. Vector fields can work with vector data represented as byte or float arrays in the documents. Out of the box byte[] and float[] property types will work with the new field type. For any other entity property types, a custom value bridge or value binder should be implemented. Keep in mind that indexed vectors must be of the same length and that this length should be specified upfront for the schema to be created: @Entity @Indexed public class Book { @Id private Integer id; @VectorField(dimension = 512) private float[] coverImageEmbeddings; // Other properties ... } Searching for vector similarities is performed via a knn predicate: float[] coverImageEmbeddingsVector = /*...*/ List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> // provide the number of similar documents to look for: f.knn( 5 ) // the name of the vector field: .field( "coverImageEmbeddings" ) // matched documents will be the ones whose indexed vector // is "most similar" to this vector .matching( coverImageEmbeddingsVector ) // additionally an optional filter can be supplied // to provide a regular fulltext search predicate .filter( f.match().field( "authors.firstName" ).matching( "arthur" ) ) ).fetchHits( 20 ); Note that each backend may have its own specifics and limitations with regard to the vector search. For more details look at the related documentation. Looking up the capabilities of each field in the metamodel It is now possible to see which capabilities (predicates/sorts/projections/etc.) are available for a field when inspecting the metamodel: SearchMapping mapping = /*...*/ ; // Retrieve a SearchIndexedEntity: SearchIndexedEntity<Book> bookEntity = mapping.indexedEntity( Book.class ); // Get the descriptor for that index. // The descriptor exposes the index metamodel: IndexDescriptor indexDescriptor = bookEntity.indexManager().descriptor(); // Retrieve a field by name // and inspect its capabilities if such field is present: indexDescriptor.field( "releaseDate" ).ifPresent( field -> { if ( field.isValueField() ) { // Get the descriptor for the field type: IndexValueFieldTypeDescriptor type = field.toValueField().type(); // Inspect the "traits" of a field type: // each trait represents a predicate/sort/projection/aggregation // that can be used on fields of that type. Set<String> traits = type.traits(); if ( traits.contains( IndexFieldTraits.Aggregations.RANGE ) ) { // ... } if ( traits.contains( IndexFieldTraits.Predicates.EXISTS ) ) { // ... } // ... } } ); Query string predicate The queryString predicate matches documents according to a structured query given as a string. It allows building more advanced query strings (using Lucene’s query language) and has more configuration options than a simpleQueryString predicate. List<Book> hits = searchSession.search( Book.class ) .where( f -> f.queryString().field( "description" ) .matching( "robots +(crime investigation disappearance)^10 +\"investigation help\"~2 -/(dis)?a[p]+ea?ance/" ) ) .fetchHits( 20 ); The query string, in this predicate, will result in a boolean query with 4 clauses: a should clause matching robots; two must clauses another boolean query constructed from (crime || investigation || disappearance) string with a boost of 10 a query matching the phrase investigation help with the phrase slop equals to 2 a must not clause matching a regular expression (dis)?a[p]+ea?ance Note that each of the mentioned clauses may itself end up being translated into other types of queries. See this section of the reference documentation on the queryString predicate for more information. Simpler entity registration in the Standalone POJO mapper Hibernate Search simplifies how entities can be defined. For standalone mapper now it is enough to annotate your entities with the @SearchEntity annotation. @SearchEntity (1) // ... Other annotations, e.g. @Indexed if this entity needs to be mapped to an index. public class Book { @Id private Integer id; // Other properties ... } 1 Annotate the type with @SearchEntity so it is treated as an entity. Another update related to this is a way the SearchMappingBuilder builder is created. Now it requires an annotated type source to be provided. CloseableSearchMapping searchMapping = SearchMapping.builder( AnnotatedTypeSource.fromClasses( (1) Book.class, Associate.class, Manager.class )) .property( "hibernate.search.backend.hosts", "elasticsearch.mycompany.com" ) (2) // ... .build(); (3) 1 Create a builder, passing an AnnotatedTypeSource to let Hibernate Search know where to look for annotations. Thanks to classpath scanning, your AnnotatedTypeSource only needs to include one class from each JAR containing annotated types. Other types should be automatically discovered. 2 Set additional configuration properties. 3 Build the SearchMapping. See this section of the reference documentation on the entity definition for more information. What’s new compared to Hibernate Search 7.0.0.CR1 HSEARCH-5083: Upgrade to AWS SDK 2.24.1. HSEARCH-5091: Upgrade to Elasticsearch client 8.12.2. HSEARCH-5087: Add compatibility with OpenSearch 2.12.0. HSEARCH-5039: Fix an issue with knn predicates that require multi-tenant filters. HSEARCH-5088: Limit OpenSearch vector search capabilities to 2.9+ versions. While earlier versions of OpenSearch have already introduced the vector search capabilities, 2.9 is the first version where all features required for integration were introduced. And more. For a full list of changes since the previous releases, please see the release notes. How to get this release All details are available and up to date on the dedicated page on hibernate.org. Getting started, migrating For new applications, refer to the getting started guide: here for the Hibernate ORM integration here for the Standalone POJO Mapper For existing applications, Hibernate Search 7.1 is a drop-in replacement for 7.0, assuming you also upgrade the dependencies.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marco Belladelli', 'Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: 6.2.6.Final. What’s new This update includes several bugfixes and further stabilization as we approach the release of the next minor Hibernate version. Bugfixes Embeddable keys and property sorting We have fixed a bug that caused the properties of composite keys to be in an unexpected order, causing possible problems with constraints (see HHH-16514) Bytecode enhancement We keep improving Hibernate’s bytecode enhancement support, this time we tackled several bugs: Reading entities that extended a @MappedSuperclass declared in a different package did not work correctly (see HHH-16711) Bytecode enhancement caused a lazy @ManyToOne association targeting an Entity annotated with @Proxy(lazy = false) to be eagerly loaded (see HHH-16794) Hibernate failed to update a one-to-one lazy association with OptimisticLockType.DIRTY and enabled bytecode enhancement (see HHH-16839) Bytecode enhancement led to a broken constructor for an embedded field declared as a generic in a @MappedSuperclass (see HHH-16832) Subqueries and joins We addressed a couple issues that affected Hibernate generated subqeries when using joins: When reusing a join in a subquery the table would be referenced again instead of reusing the join (see HHH-16537) An HQL query with a subquery that used an entity path at least two levels deep produced SQL with a missing join predicate (see HHH-16721) Polymorphic queries We have fixed some bugs related to polymorphic queries: When using a polymorphic entity-valued path as an argument for a function a SqmRoot not yet resolved to TableGroup error was triggered (see HHH-16733) An exception was thrown when processing a polymorphic entity’s nested join in a subquery (see HHH-16582) Hibernate now uses the existing SQM copy logic to process entity polymorphism, keeping the behavior consistent with what was already in place for criteria queries. Batch loading In previous 6.2 versions the batch loading feature was improved several times. With this release we keep stabilizing it by fixing a couple issues: In-clause parameter padding did not consider the Dialect’s in-expression count limit which could cause errors on the DMBS side (see HHH-16589) When batching was enabled the LockModeType requested through the session.find() method was ignored (see HHH-16820) There are more improvements and bugfixes included in this version. You can find the full list of changes here. Conclusion For additional details, see: the User Guide the Migration Guide the release page. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Steve Ebersole', '6.4 adds some cool new features, in addition to many improvements and fixes. Soft Delete 6.4 adds support for soft deletes using the new @SoftDelete annotation. @Entity @SoftDelete class Account { ... } Dealing with values as deleted/non-deleted versus active/inactive (reversed) is simple using an annotation attribute: @Entity @SoftDelete(strategy=ACTIVE) class Account { ... } It even supports pluggable converters for dealing with what gets stored in the database. See the User Guide for details. HQL/Criteria Array Functions Following up on earlier work, 6.4 adds the remaining functions for handling arrays in HQL and Criteria queries, including - array() Creates an array based on the passed arguments - e.g. array(1,2,3) array_position() Determines the position of an element in an array - e.g. where array_position(an.array,''x'') = 1 array_length() Determines the length of an array - e.g. where array_length(an.array) > 50 array_get() Accesses the element of an array by index - e.g. where array_get(an.array, 1) <> 13 array_slice() Creates a sub-array of the given array based on lower and upper index - e.g. array_slice(an.array,3,6) array_contains() Whether an array contains an element - e.g. array_contains(an.array, 1) And others… See the Query Guide for excellent coverage of these functions. These functions are still incubating and some things (names, etc) may change before Final. Java Flight Recorder Events CR1 contains support for producing a small number of Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events as a proof of concept. This works on many JDKs, but we recently discovered that not all JDKs support the JFR package despite being part of Open JDK. Long story short, If your JDK does support JFR, CR1 produces some Hibernate-specific events If your JDK does not support JFR, CR1 will not work for you. We will decide how to proceed, before 6.4 Final. Non-String Tenant Id 6.4 adds support for using tenant-id with types other than String. P.S.

What’s new This release includes some important bug fixes. Bugfixes OneToMany and @Where annotation We have fixed a bug causing an EntityNotFoundException to be thrown when EntityManager#refresh() is called for a parent entity having a child annotated with @Where (see HHH-15902) Embeddables We have fixed few issues related to embeddables: a PropertyAccessException was thrown when deleting an entity having an embeddable with a collection attribute (see HHH-16007) an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown when loading an entity having an Embeddable with more attributes than the parent that was causing (see HHH-15778) an IllegalArgumentException was thrown when deleting an entity having an embeddable with a collection attribute annotated with orphanRemoval=true (see HHH-15864) a NullPointException was thrown when the model contains a nested embeddable with a non-optional association (see HHH-15794) a ClassCastException was thrown when a not nullable OneToMany association references an entity with an embedded id (see HHH-15866 see HHH-15865) an IllegalArgumentException was thrown when retrieving by identifier entities extending a MappedSuperclass class with an embeddable id (see HHH-16070) an HibernateException was thrown when querying an entity having an embeddable with a collection attribute with cascade delete orphan (see HHH-16117) Bytecode enhancement and dirty checking We have fixed a bug causing the execution of unnecessary SQL update statements when setting a property to its current value (see HHH-16049) Polymorphic Queries We have fixed a bug causing an HibernateException when a polymorphic query contains a join (see HHH-15944) Batching We have fixed a couple of bugs affecting batch fetching: when refreshing an entity annotated with @BatchSize its lazy associations may be swapped with a wrong instance (see HHH-15851) collection batch fetching generated more queries than needed when retrieving empty collections (see HHH-16043) You can find the full list of changes in this version here.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Christian Beikov', 'Hibernate ORM version 6.2.0.Final is around the corner, and the following post tries to shed some light on one of the new features that comes with that release. Table partitioning In data management, it is sometimes necessary to split data of a table into various (physical) partitions, based on partition keys and a partitioning scheme. Every database has a different way of defining the partitioning keys and scheme for a table, but something that all of them have in common is the fact that the query planner needs to decide which partition to look into for a query. Unless the database supports globally unique indexes on partitioned tables, the query planner can’t know which partition it must target, and hence will have to plan to access every partition. This unfortunately leads to poor query planning performance on the popular open source databases PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB, which support partitioning but not globally unique indexes on partitioned tables. Partition Key Mapping After some discussions about how this could be supported in Hibernate, we went with a minimal approach first, to make sure we can help people improve their performance as soon as possible. The minimal approach is to allow marking persistent attributes to be part of the partition key, by annotating @PartitionKey. This has the effect that SQL update and delete statements, which are issued by Hibernate when flushing entity state changes, will additionally restrict the partition key columns in WHERE clause predicate. Consider the following entity model: @Entity @Table(name = "user_tbl") public static class User { @Id private Long id; private String firstname; private String lastname; @PartitionKey private String tenantKey; } When updating or deleting such an entity, Hibernate will now generate SQL similar to this: update user_tbl set firstname=?,lastname=?,tenantKey=? where id=? and tenantKey=? delete from user_tbl where id=? and tenantKey=? The presence of a restriction in the WHERE clause predicate allows the planner to take a peek at the parameter value and immediately prune tables that don’t fit the partition key. Outlook So far, Hibernate only makes use of the partitioning information in SQL update and delete statements. There were discussions about adding support for DDL generation as well, but nothing has been agreed upon yet. Do you think you could profit from DDL support?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Steve Ebersole', 'Hibernate ORM 6.2.0.CR3 has just been released. It contains 64 resolutions, including 37 bug-fixes. Many of these improvements come directly from the excellent feedback and bug reports we continue to get from the community. Thank you again for the continued support and feedback! What’s next? We will hold releasing a Final until a few integration contracts stabilize, especially as Hibernate Reactive makes a push to 2.0. That is expected to be very short term.

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marco Belladelli', 'Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: 6.2.1.Final. What’s new This release includes several bug fixes and small performance improvements. Bugfixes Sub-queries using aliases and left joins We have improved the resolution of tables in sub-queries, especially in cases where the same alias was also used in the parent query. This change also fixed a bug that caused left-joins in sub-queries to be wrongly translated (see HHH-16414). Batching We have fixed a few issues related to batching: a parameter binding error was thrown when using DynamicUpdate or DynamicInserts with batching enabled (see HHH-16352). an OptimisticLockException was thrown when an entity having a Version attribute and a dirty collection was updated with statement batching enabled (see HHH-15778). You can expect more improvements related to batching in the following Hibernate releases. Bytecode enhancement and dirty checking We have fixed a bug causing generic associations to be ignored when dirty checking and bytecode enhancement were enabled (see HHH-16459). Composite primary key querying We have fixed a bug causing part of a composite @IdClass primary key not to be returned when querying (see HHH-16387). Internal nullness marking and checking We started the internal process of reviewing the code base and adding nullness annotations which will be automatically verified thanks to the Checker Framework (see HHH-16389). You can find the full list of changes in this version here. Conclusion For additional details, see: the User Guide the Migration Guide the release page. Feedback, issues, ideas?

INSERT INTO public.articles (author, content, title, url, embedding) VALUES ('Marco Belladelli', 'Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: 6.2.4.Final. What’s new This release includes several bug fixes and small performance improvements. Type pollution improvements We keep gradually improving Hibernate’s performance, with special regard to the type pollution issue currently affecting the JDK (see HHH-16629). Hibernate Gradle plugin Dropped support for JPA static metamodel generation Support for JPA static metamodel generation in the Hibernate Gradle plugin was dropped. You can find more details here. Bugfixes Entity associations and joins We have fixed some issues related to the handling of entity associations and joins: We now avoid joining tables in more scenarios and should only introduce joins when really needed (see HHH-16691). An error was causing a result multiplication when both FetchMode.JOIN and batching were used for retrieving @OneToMany associated items (see HHH-16570). We now throw an appropriate error when an entity join that is not a cross join doesn’t define an on clause (see HHH-16495). A lazy association in a @Cacheable entity was already retrieved as initialized (see HHH-16613). Query caching We have fixed several bugs related to query caches, specifically regarding the key used for the cache: The query cache key was not correctly serializable when working with an enabled @Filter or @TenantId (see HHH-16385). @Filter parameters were not included in the query cache key causing some inconsistent results when using different values (see HHH-16617). Query parameters were not always processed in the same order when generating the query cache key, causing sporadic cache misses expecially with a high number of parameters and criteria queries (see HHH-16594). Map type associations We have a couple bugs related to Map type associations: Using the @MapKey annotation led to wrongly generated SQL for inserts in some cases (see HHH-16370). An error was encountered when using an Embeddable typed element collection in a map association (see HHH-16540). Null Pointer Exceptions The latest Hibernate updates introduced a couple cases triggering a NullPointerException that were fixed: An NPE was encountered when generating the mapping metamodel if inheritance was used for an @IdClass (see HHH-16664). An entity with an @Any annotated attribute caused a null pointer when merging (see HHH-16532). There are many more improvements and bugfixes included in this version. You can find the full list of changes here. Conclusion For additional details, see: the User Guide the Migration Guide the release page. Feedback, issues, ideas?

This release mainly upgrades to Hibernate ORM 6.2.7.Final for -orm6 artifacts, upgrades to Elasticsearch client 8.9.0, adds compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.9 and OpenSearch 2.9, and fixes several bugs. What’s new HSEARCH-4744: Hibernate Search is now able to read Jandex indexes of repackaged Spring applications (uberjars), providing the application runs on Java 13+. HSEARCH-4915: Search queries with partial failures (some successful shards, some failing) can now trigger an exception if you set the configuration property hibernate.search.backend.query.shard_failure.ignore to false. This will be the default behavior in Hibernate Search 7.
